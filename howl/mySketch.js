	"Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet, Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said: ‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah, father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said: ‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way. They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?—we thought you were never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought: ‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.’Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. ‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman, ‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlour: ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw, Who is nibbling at my little house?’ The children answered: ‘The wind, the wind, The heaven-born wind,’ and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’ Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then, Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’ said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman, ‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. ‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. ‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of water. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she cried: ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see, Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee? There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight, Take us across on thy back so white.’ The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.";

	"What I heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that people died there in alarmingly great numbers. That, I was told, was why the original owners had moved out some twenty years after building the place. It was plainly unhealthy, perhaps because of the dampness and fungous growths in the cellar, the general sickish smell, the drafts of the hallways, or the quality of the well and pump water. These things were bad enough, and these were all that gained belief among the persons whom I knew. Only the notebooks of my antiquarian uncle, Doctor Elihu Whipple, revealed to me at length the darker, vaguer surmises which formed an undercurrent of folklore among old-time servants and humble folk; surmises which never travelled far, and which were largely forgotten when Providence grew to be a metropolis with a shifting modern population. The general fact is, that the house was never regarded by the solid part of the community as in any real sense 'haunted. There were no widespread tales of rattling chains, cold currents of air, extinguished lights, or faces at the window. Extremists sometimes said the house was 'unlucky, but that is as far as even they went. What was really beyond dispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there; or more accurately, had died there, since after some peculiar happenings over sixty years ago the building had become deserted through the sheer impossibility of renting it. These persons were not all cut off suddenly by any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiously sapped, so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency to weakness he may have naturally had. And those who did not die displayed in constying degree a type of anemia or consumption, and sometimes a decline of the mental faculties, which spoke ill for the salubriousness of the building. Neighboring houses, it must be added, seemed entirely free from the noxious quality. This much I knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to show me the notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous investigation. In my childhood the shunned house was vacant, with barren, gnarled and terrible old trees, long, queerly pale grass and nightmarishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered. We boys used to overrun the place, and I can still recall my youthful terror not only at the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation, but at the eldritch atmosphere and odor of the dilapidated house, whose unlocked front door was often entered in quest of shudders. The small-paned windows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung round the precarious panelling, shaky interior shutters, peeling wall-paper, falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered furniture as still remained. The dust and cobwebs added their touch of the fearful; and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily ascend the ladder to the attic, a vast raftered length lighted only by small blinking windows in the gable ends, and filled with a massed wreckage of chests, chairs, and spinning-wheels which infinite years of deposit had shrouded and festooned into monstrous and hellish shapes. But after all, the attic was not the most terrible part of the house. It was the dank, humid cellar which somehow exerted the strongest repulsion on us, even though it was wholly above ground on the street side, with only a thin door and window-pierced brick wall to separate it from the busy sidewalk. We scarcely knew whether to haunt it in spectral fascination, or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our sanity. For one thing, the bad odor of the house was strongest there; and for another thing, we did not like the white fungous growths which occasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard earth floor. Those fungi, grotesquely like the vegetation in the yard outside, were truly horrible in their outlines; detestable parodies of toadstools and Indian-pipes, whose like we had never seen in any other situation. They rotted quickly, and at one stage became slightly phosphorescent; so that nocturnal passers-by sometimes spoke of witch-fires glowing behind the broken panes of the fetor-spreading windows. We never—even in our wildest Halloween moods—visited this cellar by night, but in some of our daytime visits could detect the phosphorescence, especially when the day was dark and wet. There was also a subtler thing we often thought we detected—a very strange thing which was, however, merely suggestive at most. I refer to a sort of cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor—a vague, shifting deposit of mold or niter which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst the sparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen. Once in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny resemblance to a doubled-up human figure, though generally no such kinship existed, and often there was no whitish deposit whatever. On a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally strong, and when, in addition, I had fancied I glimpsed a kind of thin, yellowish, shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward the yawning fireplace, I spoke to my uncle about the matter. He smiled at this odd conceit, but it seemed that his smile was tinged with reminiscence. Later I heard that a similar notion entered into some of the wild ancient tales of the common folk—a notion likewise alluding to ghoulish, wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the great chimney, and queer contours assumed by certain of the sinuous tree-roots that thrust their way into the cellar through the loose foundation-stones.";

	"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. Tis some visitor, I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door— Only this and nothing more. Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore— For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore— Nameless here for evermore. And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— This it is and nothing more. Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, 'Sir, said I, 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you'—here I opened wide the door;— Darkness there and nothing more. Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, 'Lenore?' This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, 'Lenore!'— Merely this and nothing more. Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. 'Surely, said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore— Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;— ’Tis the wind and nothing more!' Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door— Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door— Perched, and sat, and nothing more. Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, I said, art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore— Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!' Quoth the Raven Nevermore. Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door— Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as Nevermore. But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered— Till I scarcely more than muttered 'Other friends have flown before— On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before. Then the bird said Nevermore. Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, 'Doubtless, said I, 'what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of ‘Never—nevermore’. But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore— What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking 'Nevermore. This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er, But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er, She shall press, ah, nevermore! Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. 'Wretch, I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore; Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!' Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore. 'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!— Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted— On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore— Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!' Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore. 'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore— Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore— Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore. Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore. 'Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked, upstarting— 'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!' Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore. And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted—nevermore!";

const sex = `Sex is a trait that determines an individual's reproductive function, male or female, in animals and plants that propagate their species through sexual reproduction. Commonly in plants and animals, male organisms produce smaller gametes spermatozoa, sperm while female organisms produce larger gametes ova, often called egg cells. Organisms that produce both types of gametes are called hermaphrodites. During sexual reproduction, male and female gametes fuse to form zygotes that develop into offspring that inherit a selection of the traits of each parent. Males and females of a species may be similar sexual monomorphism, or have physical differences sexual dimorphism. The differences reflect the different reproductive pressures the sexes experience. For instance, mate choice and sexual selection can accelerate the evolution of physical differences between the sexes. The terms male and female typically do not apply in sexually undifferentiated species in which the individuals are isomorphic look the same and the gametes are isogamous indistinguishable in size and shape, such as the green alga Ulva lactuca. Some kinds of functional differences between gametes, such as in fungi, may be referred to as mating types. Sex is genetically determined in most mammals by the XY sex-determination system, where male mammals carry an X and a Y chromosome XY, whereas female mammals carry two X chromosomes XX. Other chromosomal sex-determination systems in animals include the ZW system in birds, and the X system in insects. Various environmental systems include temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles and crustaceans. Sexual reproduction Main article: Sexual reproduction Further information: Isogamy and Anisogamy The life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms cycles through haploid and diploid stages Sexual reproduction is a process exclusive to eukaryotes in which organisms produce offspring that possess a selection of the genetic traits of each parent. Genetic traits are contained within the deoxyribonucleic acid DNA of chromosomes. The cells of eukaryotes have a set of paired homologous chromosomes, one from each parent, and this double-chromosome stage is called diploid. During sexual reproduction, diploid organisms produce specialized haploid sex cells called gametes via meiosis, each of which has a single set of chromosomes. Meiosis involves a stage of genetic recombination via chromosomal crossover, in which regions of DNA are exchanged between matched pairs of chromosomes, to form new chromosomes each with a new and unique combination of the genes of the parents. Then the chromosomes are separated into single sets in the gametes. Each gamete in the offspring thus has half of the genetic material of the mother and half of the father. The combination of chromosomal crossover and fertilization, bringing the two single sets of chromosomes together to make a new diploid zygote, results in new organisms that contain different sets of the genetic traits of each parent. In animals, the haploid stage only occurs in the gametes, the haploid cells that are specialized to fuse to form a zygote that develops into a new diploid organism. In plants, the diploid organism produces haploid spores by meiosis that are capable of undergoing repeated cell division to produce multicellular haploid organisms. In either case, gametes may be externally similar isogamy as in the green alga Ulva or may be different in size and other aspects anisogamy. The size difference is greatest in oogamy, a type of anisogamy in which a small, motile gamete combines with a much larger, non-motile gamete. By convention, the larger gamete called an ovum, or egg cell is considered female, while the smaller gamete called a spermatozoon, or sperm cell is considered male. An individual that produces exclusively large gametes is female, and one that produces exclusively small gametes is male. An individual that produces both types of gametes is a hermaphrodite. In some cases hermaphrodites are able to self-fertilize and produce offspring on their own, without a second Animals Main article: Sexual reproduction § Animals Hoverflies mating Most sexually reproducing animals spend their lives as diploid, with the haploid stage reduced to single-cell gametes. The gametes of animals have male and female forms—spermatozoa and egg cells. These gametes combine to form embryos which develop into new organisms. The male gamete, a spermatozoon produced in vertebrates within the testes, is a small cell containing a single long flagellum which propels it. Spermatozoa are extremely reduced cells, lacking many cellular components that would be necessary for embryonic development. They are specialized for motility, seeking out an egg cell and fusing with it in a process called fertilization. Female gametes are egg cells. In vertebrates they are produced within the ovaries. They are large immobile cells that contain the nutrients and cellular components necessary for a developing embryo. Egg cells are often associated with other cells which support the development of the embryo, forming an egg. In mammals, the fertilized embryo instead develops within the female, receiving nutrition directly from its mother. Animals are usually mobile and seek out a partner of the opposite sex for mating. Animals which live in the water can mate using external fertilization, where the eggs and sperm are released into and combine within the surrounding water. Most animals that live outside of water, however, use internal fertilization, transferring sperm directly into the female to prevent the gametes from drying up. In most birds, both excretion and reproduction is done through a single posterior opening, called the cloaca—male and female birds touch cloaca to transfer sperm, a process called cloacal kissing. In many other terrestrial animals, males use specialized sex organs to assist the transport of sperm—these male sex organs are called intromittent organs. In humans and other mammals this male organ is the penis, which enters the female reproductive tract called the vagina to achieve insemination—a process called sexual intercourse. The penis contains a tube through which semen a fluid containing sperm travels. In female mammals the vagina connects with the uterus, an organ which directly supports the development of a fertilized embryo within a process called gestation. Because of their motility, animal sexual behavior can involve coercive sex. Traumatic insemination, for example, is used by some insect species to inseminate females through a wound in the abdominal cavity—a process detrimental to the female's health. Plants Flowers contain the sexual organs of flowering plants, usually containing both male and female parts. Main article: Plant reproduction Like animals, land plants have specialized male and female gametes. In seed plants, male gametes are produced by reduced male gametophytes that are contained within hard coats, forming pollen. The female gametes of seed plants are contained within ovules. Once fertilized these form seeds which, like eggs, contain the nutrients necessary for the development of the embryonic plant. Pinus nigra cone. jpg	Pine cones, immature male. jpg Female left and male right cones contain the sex organs of pines and other conifers. Some hermaphroditic plants are self-fertile, but plants have evolved multiple different self-incompatibility mechanisms to avoid self-fertilization, involving sequential hermaphroditism, molecular recognition systems and morphological mechanisms such as heterostyly. The flowers of flowering plants contain their sexual organs. Flowers are usually hermaphroditic, containing both male and female sexual organs. The female parts, in the center of a flower, are the pistils, each unit consisting of a carpel, a style and a stigma. Two or more of these reproductive units may be merged to form a single compound pistil, the fused carpels forming an ovary. Within the carpels are ovules which develop into seeds after fertilization. The male parts of the flower are the stamens: these consist of long filaments arranged between the pistil and the petals that produce pollen in anthers at their tips. When a pollen grain lands upon the stigma on top of a carpel's style, it germinates to produce a pollen tube that grows down through the tissues of the style into the carpel, where it delivers male gamete nuclei to fertilize an ovule that eventually develops into a seed. In pines and other conifers the sex organs are produced within cones that have male and female forms. The more familiar female cones are typically more durable, containing ovules within them. Male cones are smaller and produce pollen which is transported by wind to land in female cones. As with flowers, seeds form within the female cone after pollination. Because plants are immobile, they depend upon passive methods for transporting pollen grains to other plants. Many plants, including conifers and grasses, produce lightweight pollen which is carried by wind to neighboring plants. Other plants have heavier, sticky pollen that is specialized for transportation by insects. The plants attract these insects or larger animals such as humming birds and bats with flowers containing nectar and pollen. These animals transport the pollen as they move to other flowers, which also contain female reproductive organs, resulting in pollination. Fungi Main article: Mating in fungi Mushrooms are produced as part of fungal sexual reproduction Most fungi reproduce sexually and have both haploid and diploid stages in their life cycles. These fungi are typically isogamous, lacking male and female specialization: haploid fungi grow into contact with each other and then fuse their cells. In some of these cases, the fusion is asymmetric, and the cell which donates only a nucleus and not accompanying cellular material could arguably be considered male. Fungi may also have more complex allelic mating systems, with other sexes not accurately described as male, female, or hermaphroditic. Some fungi, including baker's yeast, have mating types that create a duality similar to male and female roles. Yeast with the same mating type will not fuse with each other to form diploid cells, only with yeast carrying the other mating type. Many species of higher fungi produce mushrooms as part of their sexual reproduction. Within the mushroom diploid cells are formed, later dividing into haploid spores. The height of the mushroom aids the dispersal of these sexually produced offspring. citation needed Sexual systems Main article: Sexual system A sexual system is a distribution of male and female functions across organisms in a species. Animals Approximately of animal species are have separate male and female individuals, and are said to be gonochoric or dioecious. About of animal species are hermaphroditic. This low percentage is due to the very large number of insect species, in which hermaphroditism is absent. Hermaphroditism nevertheless occurs in of animal phyla. Gonochoric individuals are either male or female throughout their lives. Gonochorism is very common in vertebrates, about of which gonochoric. The remaining that are hermaphroditic are almost all fishes. All birds and mammals are gonochoric. Plants The majority of plants are bisexual, either hermaphrodite with both stamens and pistil in the same flower or monoecious with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Only about to of flowering plants are dioecious, resulting from between and independent origins. In dioecious species male and female sexes are on separate plants. Dioecy is common in gymnosperms, in which of species are dioecious, but most conifers are monoecious. Evolution of sex Main article: Evolution of sexual reproduction Further information: Male § Evolution, and Female § Evolution See also: Mating type § Evolution, and Hermaphrodite § Evolution Different forms of anisogamy: A anisogamy of motile cells, oogamy egg cell and sperm cell, anisogamy of non-motile cells egg cell and spermatia. Different forms of isogamy: A isogamy of motile cells, isogamy of non-motile cells, conjugation. Sexual conflict underlies the evolutionary distinction between male and female with the distinction starting from anisogamy, the form of sexual reproduction that involves the union or fusion of two gametes that differ in size or form. The evolution of anisogamy is also synonymous with the evolution of male and female sexes, as well as being the starting point toward sexual dimorphism, and led to the evolution of many sex differences. It is generally accepted that isogamy was ancestral and that anisogamy evolved several times independently in different groups of eukaryotes, including protists, algae, plants and animals. However, its evolution has left no fossil evidence and until there was no genetic evidence for the evolutionary link between sexes and mating types. It is unclear whether anisogamy first led to the evolution of gonochorism or to the evolution of hermaphroditism.:   Anisogamy evolves due to disruptive selection leading to small gametes and large gametes. In anisogamous species an intermediate gamete is unable to persist. There should always be two gamete types, with all analyses showing that intermediate gamete sizes are eliminated due to selection. Sex-determination systems Main article: Sex-determination system Sex helps the spread of advantageous traits through recombination. The diagrams compare the evolution of allele frequency in a sexual population top and an asexual population bottom. The vertical axis shows frequency and the horizontal axis shows time. The alleles a/A and b/B occur at random. The advantageous alleles A and B, arising independently, can be rapidly combined by sexual reproduction into the most advantageous combination AB. Asexual reproduction takes longer to achieve this combination because it can only produce AB if A arises in an individual which already has or vice versa. The biological cause of an organism developing into one sex or the other is called sex determination. The cause may be genetic, environmental, haplodiploidy, or multiple factors. Within animals and other organisms that have genetic sex-determination systems, the determining factor may be the presence of a sex chromosome. In plants that are sexually dimorphic, such as Ginkgo biloba, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha or the dioecious species in the flowering plant genus Silene, sex may also be determined by sex chromosomes. Non-genetic systems may use environmental cues, such as the temperature during early development in crocodiles, to determine the sex of the offspring. Sex determination is often distinct from sex differentiation. Sex determination is the designation for the development stage towards either male or female while sex differentiation is the pathway towards the development of the phenotype. Genetic Like humans and most other mammals, the common fruit fly has an XY sex-determination system. XY sex determination Humans and most other mammals have an XY sex-determination system: the Y chromosome carries factors responsible for triggering male development, making XY sex determination mostly based on the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. It is the male gamete that determines the sex of the offspring. In this system XX mammals typically are female and XY typically are male. However, individuals with XXY or XYY are males, while individuals with X and XXX are females. Unusually, the platypus, a monotreme mammal, has ten sex chromosomes; females have ten X chromosomes, and males have five X chromosomes and five Y chromosomes. Platypus egg cells all have five X chromosomes, whereas sperm cells can either have five X chromosomes or five Y chromosomes. XY sex determination is found in other organisms, including insects like the common fruit fly, and some plants. In some cases, it is the number of X chromosomes that determines sex rather than the presence of a Y chromosome. In the fruit fly individuals with XY are male and individuals with XX are female; however, individuals with XXY or XXX can also be female, and individuals with X can be males. ZW sex determination In birds, which have a ZW sex-determination system, the W chromosome carries factors responsible for female development, and default development is male. In this case, ZZ individuals are male and ZW are female. It is the female gamete that determines the sex of the offspring. This system is used by birds, some fish, and some crustaceans. The majority of butterflies and moths also have a ZW sex-determination system. In groups like the Lepidoptera, females can have Z, ZZW, and even ZZWW. XO sex determination In the X sex-determination system, males have one X chromosome X while females have two XX. All other chromosomes in these diploid organisms are paired, but organisms may inherit one or two X chromosomes. This system is found in most arachnids, insects such as silverfish Apterygota, dragonflies Paleoptera and grasshoppers Exopterygota, and some nematodes, crustaceans, and gastropods. In field crickets, for example, insects with a single X chromosome develop as male, while those with two develop as female. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, most worms are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites with an XX karyotype, but occasional abnormalities in chromosome inheritance can give rise to individuals with only one X chromosome—these X individuals are fertile males and half their offspring are male. ZO sex determination In the Z sex-determination system, males have two Z chromosomes whereas females have one. This system is found in several species of moths. Environmental Main article: Environmental sex determination For many species, sex is not determined by inherited traits, citation needed but instead by environmental factors such as temperature experienced during development or later in life. citation needed In the fern Ceratopteris and other homosporous fern species, the default sex is hermaphrodite, but individuals which grow in soil that has previously supported hermaphrodites are influenced by the pheromone antheridiogen to develop as male. The bonelliidae larvae can only develop as males when they encounter a female. Sequential hermaphroditism Clownfishes are initially male; the largest fish in a group becomes female Some species can change sex over the course of their lifespan, a phenomenon called sequential hermaphroditism. Teleost fishes are the only vertebrate lineage where sequential hermaphroditism occurs. In clownfish, smaller fish are male, and the dominant and largest fish in a group becomes female; when a dominant female is absent, then her partner changes sex. clarification needed In many wrasses the opposite is true—the fish are initially female and become male when they reach a certain size. Sequential hermaphroditism also occurs in plants such as Arisaema triphyllum. Temperature-dependent sex determination Many reptiles, including all crocodiles and most turtles, have temperature-dependent sex determination. In these species, the temperature experienced by the embryos during their development determines their sex. In some turtles, for example, males are produced at lower temperatures than females; but Macroclemys females are produced at temperatures lower than °C or above °C, while males are produced in between those temperatures. Haplodiploidy Other insects, clarification needed including honey bees and ants, use a haplodiploid sex-determination system. Diploid bees and ants are generally female, and haploid individuals which develop from unfertilized eggs are male. This sex-determination system results in highly biased sex ratios, as the sex of offspring is determined by fertilization arrhenotoky or pseudo-arrhenotoky resulting in males rather than the assortment of chromosomes during meiosis. Sex ratio This section is an excerpt from Sex ratio. edit The sex ratio is the ratio of males to females in a population. The ratio tends to be : in most sexually reproducing species, which is explained by Fisher's principle. Many species deviate from an even sex ratio, either periodically or permanently. Examples include parthenogenic species, periodically mating organisms such as aphids, some eusocial wasps, bees, ants, and termites. The human sex ratio is of particular interest to anthropologists and demographers. In human societies, sex ratios at birth may be considerably skewed by factors such as the age of mother at birth and by sex-selective abortion and infanticide. Exposure to pesticides and other environmental contaminants may be a significant contributing factor as well. As of, the global sex ratio at birth is estimated at boys to girls, boys per girls. Sex differences See also: Sex differences in medicine, Sex differences in intelligence, Neuroscience of sex differences, and Sex differences in human physiology Anisogamy is the fundamental difference between male and female. Richard Dawkins has stated that it is possible to interpret all the differences between the sexes as stemming from this. Sex differences in humans include a generally larger size and more body hair in men, while women have larger breasts, wider hips, and a higher body fat percentage. In other species, there may be differences in coloration or other features, and may be so pronounced that the different sexes may be mistaken for two entirely different taxa. Sexual dimorphism Main article: Sexual dimorphism Common pheasants are sexually dimorphic in both size and appearance. In many animals and some plants, individuals of male and female sex differ in size and appearance, a phenomenon called sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism in animals is often associated with sexual selection—the mating competition between individuals of one sex vis-à-vis the opposite sex. In many cases, the male of a species is larger than the female. Mammal species with extreme sexual size dimorphism tend to have highly polygynous mating systems—presumably due to selection for success in competition with other males—such as the elephant seals. Other examples demonstrate that it is the preference of females that drives sexual dimorphism, such as in the case of the stalk-eyed fly. Females are the larger sex in a majority of animals. For instance, female southern black widow spiders are typically twice as long as the males. This size disparity may be associated with the cost of producing egg cells, which requires more nutrition than producing sperm: larger females are able to produce more eggs. Sexual dimorphism can be extreme, with males, such as some anglerfish, living parasitically on the female. Some plant species also exhibit dimorphism in which the females are significantly larger than the males, such as in the moss genus Dicranum and the liverwort genus Sphaerocarpos. There is some evidence that, in these genera, the dimorphism may be tied to a sex chromosome, or to chemical signalling from females. In birds, males often have a more colourful appearance and may have features like the long tail of male peacocks that would seem to put them at a disadvantage e. g. bright colors would seem to make a bird more visible to predators. One proposed explanation for this is the handicap principle. This hypothesis argues that, by demonstrating he can survive with such handicaps, the male is advertising his genetic fitness to females—traits that will benefit daughters as well, who will not be encumbered with such handicaps. Sexual characteristics This section is an excerpt from Sexual characteristics. edit Sexual characteristics are physical or behavioral traits of an organism typically of a sexually dimorphic organism which are indicative of its biological sex. These can include sex organs used for reproduction and secondary sex characteristics which distinguish the sexes of a species, but which are not directly part of the reproductive system. Sex differences in behavior See also: Sex differences in psychology, Animal sexual behaviour, Non-reproductive sexual behavior in animals, and Sex differences in cognition The sexes across gonochoric species usually differ in behavior. In most animal species females invest more in parental care, although in some species, such as some coucals, the males invest more parental care. Females also tend to be more choosy for who they mate with, such as most bird species. Males tend to be more competitive for mating than females. A sex organ or reproductive organ is any part of an animal or plant that is involved in sexual reproduction. The reproductive organs together constitute the reproductive system. In animals, the testis in the male, and the ovary in the female, are called the primary sex organs. pages needed All others are called secondary sex organs, divided between the external sex organs—the genitals or external genitalia, visible at birth in both sexes—and the internal sex organs. pages needed Mosses, ferns, and some similar plants have gametangia for reproductive organs, which are part of the gametophyte. The flowers of flowering plants produce pollen and egg cells, but the sex organs themselves are inside the gametophytes within the pollen and the ovule. Coniferous plants likewise produce their sexually reproductive structures within the gametophytes contained within the cones and pollen. The cones and pollen are not themselves sexual organs. Terminology The primary sex organs are the gonads, a pair of sex organs, which diverge into testes following male development or into ovaries following female development. As primary sex organs, gonads generate reproductive gametes containing inheritable DNA. They also produce most of the primary hormones that affect sexual development, and regulate other sexual organs and sexually differentiated behaviors. Secondary sex organs are the rest of the reproductive system, whether internal or external. The Latin term genitalia, sometimes anglicized as genitals, is used to describe the externally visible sex organs: in male mammals, the penis and scrotum; and in female mammals, the vulva and its organs. In general zoology, given the great variety in organs, physiologies, and behaviors involved in copulation, male genitalia are more strictly defined as all male structures that are inserted in the female or that hold her near her gonopore during sperm transfer; female genitalia are defined as those parts of the female reproductive tract that make direct contact with male genitalia or male products sperm, spermatophores during or immediately after copulation. Evolution Main article: Evolution of sexual reproduction It is hard to find a common origin for gonads but, gonads most likely evolved independently several times. At first testes and ovaries evolved due to natural selection. A consensus has emerged that sexual selection represents a primary factor for genital evolution. Male genitalia show traits of divergent evolution that are driven by sexual selection. Animals Mammals Further information: Mammalian reproductive system and Human reproductive system The visible portion of the mammalian genitals for males consists of the scrotum and penis; for females, it consists of the vulva labia, clitoris, etc. and vagina. In placental mammals, females have two genital orifices, the vagina and urethra, while males have only one, the urethra. Male and female genitals have many nerve endings, resulting in pleasurable and highly sensitive touch. In most human societies, particularly in conservative ones, exposure of the genitals is considered a public indecency. Human sexuality Form in which people experience and express themselves sexually This article is about human sexual anatomy, sexuality and perceptions. For information specifically about sexual activities, see Human sexual activity. For the book, see Human Sexuality book. Sexuality redirects here. For sexual behavior among other animals, see Animal sexual behaviour. For other uses, see Sexuality disambiguation. People together. svg Relationships Outline show Types show Activities show Endings hide Emotions and feelings AffinityAttachmentIntimacyJealousyLimerenceLove PlatonicUnconditionalPassionSexuality show Practices show Abuse Human sexuality is the way people experience and express themselves sexually. This involves biological, erotic, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual feelings and behaviors. Because it is a broad term, which has varied with historical contexts over time, it lacks a precise definition. The biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely concern the human reproductive functions, including the human sexual response cycle. Someone's sexual orientation is their pattern of sexual interest in the opposite or same sex. Physical and emotional aspects of sexuality include bonds between individuals that are expressed through profound feelings or physical manifestations of love, trust, and care. Social aspects deal with the effects of human society on one's sexuality, while spirituality concerns an individual's spiritual connection with others. Sexuality also affects and is affected by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and religious aspects of life. Interest in sexual activity typically increases when an individual reaches puberty. Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support, there is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males. Hypothesized social causes are supported by only weak evidence, distorted by numerous confounding factors. This is further supported by cross-cultural evidence, because cultures that are very tolerant of homosexuality do not have significantly higher rates of it. Evolutionary perspectives on human coupling, reproduction and reproduction strategies, and social learning theory provide further views of sexuality. Sociocultural aspects of sexuality include historical developments and religious beliefs. Some cultures have been described as sexually repressive. The study of sexuality also includes human identity within social groups, sexually transmitted infections STIs/STDs, and birth control methods. Development Sexual orientation Main article: Sexual orientation There is considerably more evidence supporting innate causes of sexual orientation than learned ones, especially for males. This evidence includes the cross-cultural correlation of homosexuality and childhood gender nonconformity, moderate genetic influences found in twin studies, evidence for prenatal hormonal effects on brain organization, the fraternal birth order effect, and the finding that in rare cases where infant males were raised as girls due to physical differences or deformity, they nevertheless turned out attracted to females. Hypothesized social causes are supported by only weak evidence, distorted by numerous confounding factors. Cross-cultural evidence also leans more toward non-social causes. Cultures that are very tolerant of homosexuality do not have significantly higher rates of it. Homosexual behavior is relatively common among boys in British single-sex boarding schools, but adult Britons who attended such schools are no more likely to engage in homosexual behavior than those who did not. In an extreme case, the Sambia people ritually require their boys to engage in homosexual behavior during adolescence before they have any access to females, yet most of these boys become heterosexual. It is not fully understood why genes causing homosexuality persist in the gene pool. One hypothesis involves kin selection, suggesting that homosexuals invest heavily enough in their relatives to offset the cost of not reproducing as much directly. This has not been supported by studies in Western cultures, but several studies in Samoa have found some support for this hypothesis. Another hypothesis involves sexually antagonistic genes, which cause homosexuality when expressed in males but increase reproduction when expressed in females. Studies in both Western and non-Western cultures have found support for this hypothesis. Gender differences See also: Sex differences in psychology § Sexual behavior Psychological theories exist regarding the development and expression of gender differences in human sexuality. A number of them including neo-analytic theories, sociobiological theories, social learning theory, social role theory, and script theory agree in predicting that men should be more approving of casual sex sex happening outside a stable, committed relationship such as marriage and should also be more promiscuous have a higher number of sexual partners than women. These theories are mostly consistent with observed differences in males' and females' attitudes toward casual sex before marriage in the United States. Other aspects of human sexuality, such as sexual satisfaction, incidence of oral sex, and attitudes toward homosexuality and masturbation, show little to no observed difference between males and females. Observed gender differences regarding the number of sexual partners are modest, with males tending to have slightly more than females. Biological and physiological aspects Main article: Human reproductive system Like other mammals, humans are primarily grouped into either the male or female sex. The biological aspects of humans' sexuality deal with the reproductive system, the sexual response cycle, and the factors that affect these aspects. They also deal with the influence of biological factors on other aspects of sexuality, such as organic and neurological responses, heredity, hormonal issues, gender issues, and sexual dysfunction. Physical anatomy and reproduction Males and females are anatomically similar; this extends to some degree to the development of the reproductive system. As adults, they have different reproductive mechanisms that enable them to perform sexual acts and to reproduce. Men and women react to sexual stimuli in a similar fashion with minor differences. Women have a monthly reproductive cycle, whereas the male sperm production cycle is more continuous. Brain The hypothalamus is the most important part of the brain for sexual functioning. This is a small area at the base of the brain consisting of several groups of nerve cell bodies that receives input from the limbic system. Studies have shown that within lab animals, the destruction of certain areas of the hypothalamus causes the elimination of sexual behavior. The hypothalamus is important because of its relationship to the pituitary gland, which lies beneath it. The pituitary gland secretes hormones that are produced in the hypothalamus and itself. The four important sexual hormones are oxytocin, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone. Oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the love hormone, is released in both sexes during sexual intercourse when an orgasm is achieved. Oxytocin has been suggested as critical to the thoughts and behaviors required to maintain close relationships. verification needed The hormone is also released in women when they give birth or are breastfeeding. Prolactin and oxytocin are responsible for inducing milk production in women. Follicle-stimulating hormone FSH is responsible for ovulation in women, which acts by triggering egg maturity; in men it stimulates sperm production. Luteinizing hormone LH triggers ovulation, which is the release of a mature egg. Male anatomy and reproductive system Main article: Human male reproductive system Males also have both internal and external genitalia that are responsible for procreation and sexual intercourse. Production of spermatozoa sperm is also cyclic, but unlike the female ovulation cycle, the sperm production cycle is constantly producing millions of sperm daily. External male anatomy External male genitals depilated. The male genitalia are the penis and the scrotum. The penis provides a passageway for sperm and urine. The penis consists of nerves, blood vessels, fibrous tissue, and three parallel cylinders of spongy tissue. Other components of the penis include the shaft, glans, root, cavernous bodies, and spongy body. The three cylindrical bodies of spongy tissue, which are filled with blood vessels, run along the length of the shaft. The two bodies that lie side by side in the upper portion of the penis are the corpora cavernosa cavernous bodies. The third, called the corpus spongiosum spongy body, is a tube that lies centrally beneath the others and expands at the end to form the tip of the penis glans. The raised rim at the border of the shaft and glans is called the corona. The urethra connects the urinary bladder to the penis where urine exits the penis through the urethral meatus. The urethra eliminates urine and acts as a channel for semen and sperm to exit the body during sexual intercourse. The root consists of the expanded ends of the cavernous bodies, which fan out to form the crura and attach to the pubic bone and the expanded end of the spongy body. The bulb of the penis is surrounded by the bulbospongiosus muscle, while the corpora cavernosa are surrounded by the ischiocavernosus muscles. These aid urination and ejaculation. The penis has a foreskin that typically covers the glans; this is sometimes removed by circumcision for medical, religious or cultural reasons. In the scrotum, the testicles are held away from the body, one possible reason for this is so sperm can be produced in an environment slightly lower than normal body temperature. The penis has very little muscular tissue, and this exists in its root. The shaft and glans have no muscle fibers. Unlike most other primates, male humans lack a penile bone. Internal male anatomy The male reproductive system. Male internal reproductive structures are the testicles, the duct system, the prostate and seminal vesicles, and the Cowper's gland. The testicles male gonads, are where sperm and male hormones are produced. Millions of sperm are produced daily in several hundred seminiferous tubules. Cells called the Leydig cells lie between the tubules; these produce hormones called androgens; these consist of testosterone and inhibin. The testicles are held by the spermatic cord, which is a tubelike structure containing blood vessels, nerves, the vas deferens, and a muscle that helps to raise and lower the testicles in response to temperature changes and sexual arousal, in which the testicles are drawn closer to the body. Sperm gets transported through a four-part duct system. The first part of this system is the epididymis. The testicles converge to form the seminiferous tubules, coiled tubes at the top and back of each testicle. The second part of the duct system is the vas deferens, a muscular tube that begins at the lower end of the epididymis. The vas deferens passes upward along the side of the testicles to become part of the spermatic cord. The expanded end is the ampulla, which stores sperm before ejaculation. The third part of the duct system is the ejaculatory ducts, which are -inch. cm-long paired tubes that pass through the prostate gland, where semen is produced. The prostate gland is a solid, chestnut-shaped organ that surrounds the first part of the urethra, which carries urine and semen. Similar to the female G-spot, the prostate provides sexual stimulation and can lead to orgasm through anal sex. The prostate gland and the seminal vesicles produce seminal fluid that is mixed with sperm to create semen. The prostate gland lies under the bladder and in front of the rectum. It consists of two main zones: the inner zone that produces secretions to keep the lining of the male urethra moist and the outer zone that produces seminal fluids to facilitate the passage of semen. The seminal vesicles secrete fructose for sperm activation and mobilization, prostaglandins to cause uterine contractions that aid movement through the uterus, and bases that help neutralize the acidity of the vagina. The Cowper's glands, or bulbourethral glands, are two pea-sized structures beneath the prostate. Female anatomy and reproductive system Main article: Human female reproductive system External female anatomy External female genitals depilated. The mons veneris, also known as the Mound of Venus, is a soft layer of fatty tissue overlaying the pubic bone. Following puberty, this area grows in size. It has many nerve endings and is sensitive to stimulation. The labia minora and labia majora are collectively known as the lips. The labia majora are two elongated folds of skin extending from the mons to the perineum. Its outer surface becomes covered with hair after puberty. In between the labia majora are the labia minora, two hairless folds of skin that meet above the clitoris to form the clitoral hood, which is highly sensitive to touch. The labia minora become engorged with blood during sexual stimulation, causing them to swell and turn red. The labia minora are composed of connective tissues that are richly supplied with blood vessels which cause a pinkish appearance. Near the anus, the labia minora merge with the labia majora. In a sexually unstimulated state, the labia minora protects the vaginal and urethral opening by covering them. At the base of the labia minora are the Bartholin's glands, which add a few drops of an alkaline fluid to the vagina via ducts; this fluid helps to counteract the acidity of the outer vagina since sperm cannot live in an acidic environment. The clitoris is developed from the same embryonic tissue as the penis; it or its glans alone consists of as many or more in some cases nerve endings as the human penis or glans penis, making it extremely sensitive to touch. The clitoral glans, which is a small, elongated erectile structure, has only one known function—sexual sensations. It is the female's most sensitive erogenous zone and the main source of orgasm in women. Thick secretions called smegma collect around the clitoris. The vaginal opening and the urethral opening are only visible when the labia minora are parted. These openings have many nerve endings that make them sensitive to touch. They are surrounded by a ring of sphincter muscles called the bulbocavernosus muscle. Underneath this muscle and on opposite sides of the vaginal opening are the vestibular bulbs, which help the vagina grip the penis by swelling with blood during arousal. Within the vaginal opening is the hymen, a thin membrane that partially covers the opening in many virgins. Rupture of the hymen has been historically considered the loss of one's virginity, though, by modern standards, loss of virginity is considered to be the first sexual intercourse. The hymen can be ruptured by activities other than sexual intercourse. The urethral opening connects to the bladder with the urethra; it expels urine from the bladder. This is located below the clitoris and above the vaginal opening. The breasts are the subcutaneous tissues on the front thorax of the female body. Though they are not technically part of a woman's sexual anatomy, they do have roles in both sexual pleasure and reproduction. Breasts are modified sweat glands made up of fibrous tissues and fat that provide support and contain nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels. Their main purpose is to provide milk to a developing infant. Breasts develop during puberty in response to an increase in estrogen. Each adult breast consists of to milk-producing mammary glands, irregularly shaped lobes that include alveolar glands and a lactiferous duct leading to the nipple. The lobes are separated by dense connective tissues that support the glands and attach them to the tissues on the underlying pectoral muscles. Other connective tissue, which forms dense strands called suspensory ligaments, extends inward from the skin of the breast to the pectoral tissue to support the weight of the breast. Heredity and the quantity of fatty tissue determine the size of the breasts. Men typically find female breasts attractive and this holds true for a variety of cultures. In women, stimulation of the nipple seems to result in activation of the brain's genital sensory cortex the same region of the brain activated by stimulation of the clitoris, vagina, and cervix. This may be why many women find nipple stimulation arousing and why some women are able to orgasm by nipple stimulation alone. Internal female anatomy Main article: Female reproductive system The female reproductive system. The female internal reproductive organs are the vagina, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The vagina is a sheath-like canal that extends from the vulva to the cervix. It receives the penis during intercourse and serves as a depository for sperm. The vagina is also the birth canal; it can expand to labor and delivery. The vagina is located between the bladder and the rectum. The vagina is normally collapsed, but during sexual arousal it opens, lengthens, and produces lubrication to allow the insertion of the penis. The vagina has three layered walls; it is a self-cleaning organ with natural bacteria that suppress the production of yeast. The G-spot, named after the Ernst Gräfenberg who first reported it in, may be located in the front wall of the vagina and may cause orgasms. This area may vary in size and location between women; in some it may be absent. Various researchers dispute its structure or existence, or regard it as an extension of the clitoris. The uterus or womb is a hollow, muscular organ where a fertilized egg ovum will implant itself and grow into a fetus. The uterus lies in the pelvic cavity between the bladder and the bowel, and above the vagina. It is usually positioned in a -degree angle tilting forward, although in about of women it tilts backwards. The uterus has three layers; the innermost layer is the endometrium, where the egg is implanted. During ovulation, this thickens for implantation. If implantation does not occur, it is sloughed off during menstruation. The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus. The broad part of the uterus is the fundus. During ovulation, the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about four inches cm from both sides of the uterus. Finger-like projections at the ends of the tubes brush the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus. After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging fertilization and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, identical twins are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or fraternal twins. The ovaries female gonads, develop from the same embryonic tissue as the testicles. The ovaries are suspended by ligaments and are the source where ova are stored and developed before ovulation. The ovaries also produce female hormones progesterone and estrogen. Within the ovaries, each ovum is surrounded by other cells and contained within a capsule called a primary follicle. At puberty, one or more of these follicles are stimulated to mature on a monthly basis. Once matured, these are called Graafian follicles. The female reproductive system does not produce the ova; about, ova are present at birth, only of which will mature during the woman's lifetime. Ovulation is based on a monthly cycle; the th day is the most fertile. On days one to four, menstruation and production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, and the endometrium starts thinning. The endometrium is sloughed off for the next three to six days. Once menstruation ends, the cycle begins again with an FSH surge from the pituitary gland. Days five to thirteen are known as the pre-ovulatory stage. During this stage, the pituitary gland secretes follicle-stimulating hormone FSH. A negative feedback loop is enacted when estrogen is secreted to inhibit the release of FSH. Estrogen thickens the endometrium of the uterus. A surge of Luteinizing Hormone LH triggers ovulation. On day, the LH surge causes a Graafian follicle to surface the ovary. The follicle ruptures and the ripe ovum is expelled into the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tubes pick up the ovum with the fimbria. The cervical mucus changes to aid the movement of sperm. On days to —the post-ovulatory stage, the Graafian follicle—now called the corpus luteum—secretes estrogen. Production of progesterone increases, inhibiting LH release. The endometrium thickens to prepare for implantation, and the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized and does not implant, menstruation begins. Sexual response cycle The sexual response cycle is a model that describes the physiological responses that occur during sexual activity. This model was created by William Masters and Virginia Johnson. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases; excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution, also called the EPOR model. During the excitement phase of the EPOR model, one attains the intrinsic motivation to have sex. The plateau phase is the precursor to orgasm, which may be mostly biological for men and mostly psychological for women. Orgasm is the release of tension, and the resolution period is the unaroused state before the cycle begins again. The male sexual response cycle starts in the excitement phase; two centers in the spine are responsible for erections. Vasoconstriction in the penis begins, the heart rate increases, the scrotum thickens, the spermatic cord shortens, and the testicles become engorged with blood. In the plateau phase, the penis increases in diameter, the testicles become more engorged, and the Cowper's glands secrete pre-seminal fluid. The orgasm phase, during which rhythmic contractions occur every. secondsverification needed, consists of two phases; the emission phase, in which contractions of the vas deferens, prostate, and seminal vesicles encourage ejaculation, which is the second phase of orgasm. Ejaculation is called the expulsion phase; it cannot be reached without an orgasm. In the resolution phase, the male is now in an unaroused state consisting of a refractory rest period before the cycle can begin. This rest period may increase with age. The female sexual response begins with the excitement phase, which can last from several minutes to several hours. Characteristics of this phase include increased heart and respiratory rate, and an elevation of blood pressure. Flushed skin or blotches of redness may occur on the chest and back; breasts increase slightly in size and nipples may become hardened and erect. The onset of vasocongestion results in swelling of the clitoris, labia minora, and vagina. The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening tightens and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating liquid. The second phase, called the plateau phase, is characterized primarily by the intensification of the changes begun during the excitement phase. The plateau phase extends to the brink of orgasm, which initiates the resolution stage; the reversal of the changes begun during the excitement phase. During the orgasm stage the heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and breathing rates peak. The pelvic muscle near the vagina, the anal sphincter, and the uterus contract. Muscle contractions in the vaginal area create a high level of pleasure, though all orgasms are centered in the clitoris. Sexual dysfunction and sexual problems Main article: Sexual dysfunction Sexual disorders, according to the DSM-IV-TR, are disturbances in sexual desire and psycho-physiological changes that characterize the sexual response cycle and cause marked distress and interpersonal difficulty. The sexual dysfunctions is a result of physical or psychological disorders. The physical causes include hormonal imbalance, diabetes, heart disease and more. The psychological causes includes but are not limited to stress, anxiety, and depression. The sexual dysfunction affects men and women. There are four major categories of sexual problems for women: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasmic disorders, and sexual pain disorders. The sexual desire disorder occurs when an individual lacks the sexual desire because of hormonal changes, depression, and pregnancy. The arousal disorder is a female sexual dysfunction. Arousal disorder means lack of vaginal lubrication. In addition, blood flow problems may affect arousal disorder. Lack of orgasm, also known as, anorgasmia is another sexual dysfunction in women. The anorgasmia occurs in women with psychological disorders such as guilt and anxiety that was caused by sexual assault. The last sexual disorder is the painful intercourse. The sexual disorder can be result of pelvic mass, scar tissue, sexually transmitted disease and more. There are also three common sexual disorders for men including, sexual desire, ejaculation disorder, and erectile dysfunction. The lack of sexual desire in men is because of loss of libido, low testosterone. There are also psychological factors such as anxiety, and depression. The ejaculation disorder has three types: retrograde ejaculation, retarded ejaculation, premature ejaculation. The erectile dysfunction is a disability to have and maintain an erection during intercourse. Psychological aspects As one form of behavior, the psychological aspects of sexual expression have been studied in the context of emotional involvement, gender identity, intersubjective intimacy, and Darwinian reproductive efficacy. Sexuality in humans generates profound emotional and psychological responses. Some theorists identify sexuality as the central source of human personality. Psychological studies of sexuality focus on psychological influences that affect sexual behavior and experiences. Early psychological analyses were carried out by Sigmund Freud, who believed in a psychoanalytic approach. He also proposed the concepts of psychosexual development and the Oedipus complex, among other theories. better source needed Gender identity is a person's sense of their own gender, whether male, female, or non-binary. Gender identity can correlate with assigned sex at birth or can differ from it. All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's social identity in relation to other members of society. Sexual behavior and intimate relationships are strongly influenced by a person's sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is an enduring pattern of romantic or sexual attraction or a combination of these to persons of the opposite sex, same sex, or both sexes. Heterosexual people are romantically/sexually attracted to the members of the opposite sex, gay and lesbian people are romantically/sexually attracted to people of the same sex, and those who are bisexual are romantically/sexually attracted to both sexes. The idea that homosexuality results from reversed gender roles is reinforced by the media's portrayal of male homosexuals as effeminate and female homosexuals as masculine. However, a person's conformity or non-conformity to gender stereotypes does not always predict sexual orientation. Society believes that if a man is masculine he is heterosexual, and if a man is feminine he is homosexual. There is no strong evidence that a homosexual or bisexual orientation must be associated with atypical gender roles. By the early st century, homosexuality was no longer considered to be a pathology. Theories have linked many factors, including genetic, anatomical, birth order, and hormones in the prenatal environment, to homosexuality. Other than the need to procreate, there are many other reasons people have sex. According to one study conducted on college students Meston and Buss, the four main reasons for sexual activities are; physical attraction, as a means to an end, to increase emotional connection, and to alleviate insecurity. Sexuality and age Child sexuality Main article: Child sexuality Until Sigmund Freud published his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality in, children were often regarded as asexual, having no sexuality until later development. Sigmund Freud was one of the first researchers to take child sexuality seriously. His ideas, such as psychosexual development and the Oedipus conflict, have been much debated but acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was an important development. Freud gave sexual drives an importance and centrality in human life, actions, and behavior; he said sexual drives exist and can be discerned in children from birth. He explains this in his theory of infantile sexuality, and says sexual energy libido is the most important motivating force in adult life. Freud wrote about the importance of interpersonal relationships to one's sexual and emotional development. From birth, the mother's connection to the infant affects the infant's later capacity for pleasure and attachment. Freud described two currents of emotional life; an affectionate current, including our bonds with the important people in our lives; and a sensual current, including our wish to gratify sexual impulses. During adolescence, a young person tries to integrate these two emotional currents. Alfred Kinsey also examined child sexuality in his Kinsey Reports. Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions. For example, they wonder where babies come from, they notice the differences between males and females, and many engage in genital play, which is often mistaken for masturbation. Child sex play, also known as playing doctor, includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends. Sex play with others usually decreases as children grow, but they may later possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, but the main surge in sexual interest occurs in adolescence. Sexuality in late adulthood Main article: Sexuality in older age Adult sexuality originates in childhood. However, like many other human capacities, sexuality is not fixed, but matures and develops. A common stereotype associated with old people is that they tend to lose interest and the ability to engage in sexual acts once they reach late adulthood. This misconception is reinforced by Western popular culture, which often ridicules older adults who try to engage in sexual activities. Age does not necessarily change the need or desire to be sexually expressive or active. A couple in a long-term relationship may find that the frequency of their sexual activity decreases over time and the type of sexual expression may change, but many couples experience increased intimacy and love. Sociocultural aspects A women's liberation march in Washington, D. C., in August, from Farragut Square to Lafayette Park. A Gay Liberation march in London, UK, c. . A Gay Liberation Front banner is visible. Location is believed to be Trafalgar Square. Human sexuality can be understood as part of the social life of humans, which is governed by implied rules of behavior and the status quo. This narrows the view to groups within a society. The socio-cultural context of society, including the effects of politics and the mass media, influences and forms social norms. Throughout history, social norms have been changing and continue to change as a result of movements such as the sexual revolution and the rise of feminism. Sex education The age and manner in which children are informed of issues of sexuality is a matter of sex education. The school systems in almost all developed countries have some form of sex education, but the nature of the issues covered varies widely. In some countries, such as Australia and much of Europe, age-appropriate sex education often begins in pre-school, whereas other countries leave sex education to the pre-teenage and teenage years. Sex education covers a range of topics, including the physical, mental, and social aspects of sexual behavior. Geographic location also plays a role in society's opinion of the appropriate age for children to learn about sexuality. According to TIME magazine and CNN, of teenagers in the United States reported that their major sources of sexual information were their peers and the media, compared to who named their parents or a sex education course. In the United States, most sex education programs encourage abstinence, the choice to restrain oneself from sexual activity. In contrast, comprehensive sex education aims to encourage students to take charge of their own sexuality and know how to have safe, healthy, and pleasurable sex if and when they choose to do so. Proponents for an abstinence-only education believe that teaching a comprehensive curriculum would encourage teenagers to have sex, while proponents for comprehensive sex education argue that many teenagers will have sex regardless and should be equipped with knowledge of how to have sex responsibly. According to data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, many teens who intend to be abstinent fail to do so, and when these teenagers do have sex, many do not use safe sex practices such as contraceptives. Sexuality in history Main article: History of human sexuality Sexuality has been an important, vital part of human existence throughout history. All civilizations have managed sexuality through sexual standards, representations, and behavior. Before the rise of agriculture, groups of hunter-gatherers and nomadic groups inhabited the world. These groups had less restrictive sexual standards that emphasized sexual pleasure and enjoyment, but with definite rules and constraints. Some underlying continuities or key regulatory standards contended with the tension between recognition of pleasure, interest, and the need to procreate for the sake of social order and economic survival. Hunter-gatherers also placed high value on certain types of sexual symbolism. A common tension in hunter-gatherer societies is expressed in their art, which emphasized male sexuality and prowess, but also blurred gender lines in sexual matters. One example of these male-dominated portrayals is the Egyptian creation myth, in which the sun god Atum masturbates in the water, creating the Nile River. In Sumerian myth, the gods' semen filled the Tigris. Once agricultural societies emerged, the sexual framework shifted in ways that persisted for many millennia in much of Asia, Africa, Europe, and parts of the Americas. One common characteristic new to these societies was the collective supervision of sexual behavior due to urbanization and the growth of population and population density. Children would commonly witness parents having sex because many families shared the same sleeping quarters. Due to land ownership, determination of children's paternity became important, and society and family life became patriarchal. citation needed These changes in sexual ideology were used to control female sexuality and to differentiate standards by gender. With these ideologies, sexual possessiveness and increases in jealousy emerged. While retaining the precedents of earlier civilizations, each classical civilization established a somewhat distinctive approach to gender, artistic expression of sexual beauty, and to behaviors such as homosexuality. Some of these distinctions are portrayed in sex manuals, which were also common among civilizations in China, Greece, Rome, Persia, and India; each has its own sexual history. Before the High Middle Ages, homosexual acts appear to have been ignored or tolerated by the Christian church. During the century, hostility toward homosexuality began to spread throughout religious and secular institutions. By the end of the century, it was viewed as a pathology. During the beginning of the industrial revolution of the th and th centuries, many changes in sexual standards occurred. New artificial birth control devices such as the condom and diaphragm were introduced. Doctors started claiming a new role in sexual matters, urging that their advice was crucial to sexual morality and health. New pornographic industries grew and Japan adopted its first laws against homosexuality. In Western societies, the definition of homosexuality was constantly changing; Western influence on other cultures became more prevalent. New contacts created serious issues around sexuality and sexual traditions. There were also major shifts in sexual behavior. During this period, puberty began occurring at younger ages, so a new focus on adolescence as a time of sexual confusion and danger emerged. There was a new focus on the purpose of marriage; it was increasing regarded as being for love rather than only for economics and reproduction. Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud adopted more accepting stances toward homosexuality; Ellis said homosexuality was inborn and therefore not immoral, not a disease, and that many homosexuals made significant contributions to society. Freud wrote that all human beings as capable of becoming either heterosexual or homosexual; neither orientation was assumed to be innate. According to Freud, a person's orientation depended on the resolution of the Oedipus complex. He said male homosexuality resulted when a young boy had an authoritarian, rejecting mother and turned to his father for love and affection, and later to men in general. He said female homosexuality developed when a girl loved her mother and identified with her father, and became fixated at that stage. Alfred Kinsey initiated the modern era of sex research. He collected data from questionnaires given to his students at Indiana University, but then switched to personal interviews about sexual behaviors. Kinsey and his colleagues sampled, men and, women. He found that most people masturbated, that many engaged in oral sex, that women are capable of having multiple orgasms, and that many men had had some type of homosexual experience in their lifetimes. Before William Masters, a physician, and Virginia Johnson, a behavioral scientist, the study of anatomy and physiological studies of sex was still limited to experiments with laboratory animals. Masters and Johnson started to directly observe and record the physical responses in humans that are engaged in sexual activity under laboratory settings. They observed, episodes of sexual acts between men and women. This led to methods of treating clinical problems and abnormalities. Masters and Johnson opened the first sex therapy clinic in. In, they described their therapeutic techniques in their book, Human Sexual Inadequacy. The first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association, classified homosexuality as a mental illness, and more specifically, a sociopathic personality disturbance. This definition remained the professional understanding of homosexuality until when the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from their list of diagnoses for mental disorders. Through her research of heterosexual and homosexual men, Evelyn Hooker revealed that there was no correlation between homosexuality and psychological maladjustment, and her findings played a pivotal role in shifting the scientific community away from the perspective that homosexuality was something that needed to be treated or cured. citation needed Sexuality, colonialism, and race European conquerors/colonists found sexuality out of their norm about when Vasco Núñez de Balboa, a Spanish explorer, discovered indigenous people in Central America with different sexual practices. Balboa found some indigenous men dressed up as women, clarification needed resulting in him feeding forty of these men to his dogs for having different sexual practices. In North America and the United States, Europeans have used claims of sexual immorality to justify discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities. Scholars also study the ways in which colonialism has affected sexuality today and argue that due to racism and slavery it has been dramatically changed from the way it had previously been understood. In her book, Carnal Knowledge and Imperial Power: Gender, Race, and Morality in Colonial Asia, Laura Stoler investigates how the Dutch used sexual control and gender-specific sexual sanctions to distinguish between the rulers from the ruled and enforce colonial domination onto the people of Indonesia. In America, there are native tribes that are recorded to have embraced two-spirit people within their tribes, but the total number of tribes could be greater than what is documented. Two-spirit people were and still are members of communities who do not fall under Western gender categories of male and female, but rather under a third gender category. This system of gender contradicts both the gender binary and the assertion that sex and gender are the same. Instead of conforming to traditional roles of men and women, two-spirit fill a special niche in their communities. For example, two-spirited people are commonly revered for possessing special wisdom and spiritual powers. Two-spirited people also can take part in marriages, either monogamous and polygamous ones. Historically, European colonizers perceived relationships involving two-spirited people as homosexuality, and therefore believed in the moral inferiority of native people. In reaction, colonizers began to impose their own religious and social norms on indigenous communities, diminishing the role of two-spirit people in native cultures. Within reservations, the Religious Crime Code of the s explicitly aimed to aggressively attack Native sexual and marriage practices. The goal of colonizers was for native peoples to assimilate into Euro-American ideals of family, sexuality, gender expression, and more. The link between constructed sexual meanings and racial ideologies has been studied. According to Joane Nagel, sexual meanings are constructed to maintain racial-ethnic-national boundaries by the denigration of others and regulation of sexual behavior within the group. She writes, both adherence to and deviation from such approved behaviors, define and reinforce racial, ethnic, and nationalist regimes. In the United States people of color face the effects of colonialism in different ways with stereotypes such as the Mammy and Jezebel for Black women; lotus blossom and dragon lady for Asian women; and the spicy Latina. These stereotypes contrast with standards of sexual conservatism, creating a dichotomy that dehumanizes and demonizes the stereotyped groups. An example of a stereotype that lies at the intersection of racism, classism, and misogyny is the archetype of the welfare queen. Cathy Cohen describes how the welfare queen stereotype demonizes poor black single mothers for deviating from conventions surrounding family structure. Reproductive and sexual rights Further information: Reproductive health and Reproductive rights Reproductive and sexual rights encompass the concept of applying human rights to issues related to reproduction and sexuality. This concept is a modern one, and remains controversial since it deals, directly and indirectly, with issues such as contraception, LGBT rights, abortion, sex education, freedom to choose a partner, freedom to decide whether to be sexually active or not, right to bodily integrity, freedom to decide whether or not, and when, to have children. These are all global issues that exist in all cultures to some extent, but manifest differently depending on the specific contexts. According to the Swedish government, sexual rights include the right of all people to decide over their own bodies and sexuality and reproductive rights comprise the right of individuals to decide on the number of children they have and the intervals at which they are born. Such rights are not accepted in all cultures, with practices such criminalization of consensual sexual activities such as those related to homosexual acts and sexual acts outside marriage, acceptance of forced marriage and child marriage, failure to criminalize all non-consensual sexual encounters such as marital rape, female genital mutilation, or restricted availability of contraception, being common around the world. Stigma of contraceptives in the U. S. In, Emma Goldman and Margaret Sanger, leaders of the birth control movement, began to spread information regarding contraception in opposition to the laws, such as the Comstock Law, that demonized it. One of their main purposes was to assert that the birth control movement was about empowering women with personal reproductive and economic freedom for those who could not afford to parent a child or simply did not want one. Goldman and Sanger saw it necessary to educate people as contraceptives were quickly being stigmatized as a population control tactic due to being a policy limiting births, disregarding that this limitation did not target ecological, political, or large economic conditions. This stigma targeted lower-class women who had the most need of access to contraception. Birth control finally began to lose stigma in when the ruling of U. S. v. One Package declared that prescribing contraception to save a person's life or well-being was no longer illegal under the Comstock Law. Although opinions varied on when birth control should be available to women, by, there were birth control clinics in the United States but advertising their services remained illegal. The stigma continued to lose credibility as First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly showed her support for birth control through the four terms her husband served –. However, it was not until that the Federal Government began to fund family planning and subsidized birth control services for lower-class women and families at the order of President Lyndon B. Johnson. This funding continued after under the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act. Today, all Health Insurance Marketplace plans are required to cover all forms of contraception, including sterilization procedures, as a result of The Affordable Care Act signed by President Barack Obama in. Stigma and activism during the AIDS epidemic In, doctors diagnosed the first reported cases of AIDS in America. The disease disproportionately affected and continues to affect gay and bisexual men, especially black and Latino men. The Reagan administration is criticized for its apathy towards the AIDS epidemic, and audio recordings reveal that Ronald Reagan's press secretary Larry Speakes viewed the epidemic as a joke, mocking AIDS by calling it the gay plague. The epidemic also carried stigma coming from religious influences. For example, Cardinal Krol voiced that AIDS was an act of vengeance against the sin of homosexuality, which clarifies the specific meaning behind the pope's mention of the moral source of AIDS. Activism during the AIDS crisis focused on promoting safe sex practices to raise awareness that the disease could be prevented. The Safe Sex is Hot Sex campaign, for example, aimed to promote the use of condoms. Campaigns by the U. S. government, however, diverged from advocacy of safe sex. In, Congress even denied federal funding from awareness campaigns that promoted or encouraged, directly or indirectly, homosexual activities. Instead, campaigns by the government primarily relied on scare tactics in order to instill fear in men who had sex with other men. In addition to prevention campaigns, activists also sought to counteract narratives that led to the social death for people living with AIDS. Gay men from San Francisco and New York City created the Denver Principles, a foundational document that demanded the rights, agency, and dignity of people living with AIDS. In his article Emergence of Gay Identity and Gay Social Movements in Developing Countries, Matthew Roberts discusses how international AIDS prevention campaigns created opportunities for gay men to interact with other openly gay men from other countries. These interactions allowed western gay culture to be introduced to gay men in countries where homosexuality wasn't an important identifier. Thus, group organizers self-identified as gay more and more, creating the basis for further development of gay consciousness in different countries. Sexual behavior General activities and health Main article: Human sexual activity See also: Sexual intercourse § Health effects, and Sexually active life expectancy In humans, sexual intercourse and sexual activitycitation needed in general have been shown to have health benefits, such as an improved sense of smell, reduction in stress and blood pressure, increased immunity, and decreased risk of prostate cancer. Sexual intimacy and orgasms increase levels of oxytocin, which helps people bond and build trust. A long-term study of, people between ages and by clinical neuropsychologist David Weeks, MD, head of old-age psychology at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital in Scotland, said he found that sex helps you look between four and seven years younger, according to impartial ratings of the subjects' photographs. Exclusive causation, however, is unclear, and the benefits may be indirectly related to sex and directly related to significant reductions in stress, greater contentment, and better sleep that sex promotes. Sexual intercourse can also be a disease vector. There are million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases STD every year in the U. S., and worldwide there are over million sexually transmitted infections each year. More than half of these occur in adolescents and young adults aged – years. At least one in four US teenage girls has a sexually transmitted disease. In the U. S., about of - to -year-olds have had sexual intercourse, but only about of - to -year-olds report using condoms for their first sexual intercourse. In one study, more than of young women age – years felt they were at low risk of acquiring an STD. Creating a relationship ‹ The template below More citations needed section is being considered for merging. See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus. › The Flirtation, Eugene de Blaas. People both consciously and subconsciously seek to attract others with whom they can form deep relationships. This may be for companionship, procreation, or an intimate relationship. This involves interactive processes whereby people find and attract potential partners and maintain a relationship. These processes, which involve attracting one or more partners and maintaining sexual interest, can include: Flirting, the use of indirect behavior to convey romantic or sexual interest. It can involve verbal or non-verbal cues, such as sexual comments, body language, gazing, or close proximity to another, but non-verbal flirting is more common. Flirting is a socially accepted way of attracting someone. There are different types of flirting, and most people usually have one way of flirting that makes them most comfortable. When flirting, people can be polite, playful, physical, etc. Sometimes it is difficult to know whether or not the person is interested. Non-verbal flirting allows people to test another's interest without fear of direct rejection. Flirting styles vary according to culture. Different cultures have different social etiquette. For example, length of eye contact, or how closely one stands by someone. Seduction, the process whereby one person deliberately entices another to engage in sexual behavior. This behavior is one that the person you are seducing would not usually do, unless sexually aroused. Seduction can be seen as both a positive and a negative. Since the word seduction has a Latin meaning, which is to lead astray it can be viewed negatively. Sexual attraction Main article: Sexual attraction Sexual attraction is attraction on the basis of sexual desire or the quality of arousing such interest. Sexual attractiveness or sex appeal is an individual's ability to attract the sexual or erotic interest of another person, and is a factor in sexual selection or mate choice. The attraction can be to the physical or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context in which they appear. The attraction may be to a person's aesthetics or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume, hair length and style, and anything else which can attract the sexual interest of another person. It can also be influenced by individual genetic, psychological, or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities of the person. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and also on the criteria of the person who is attracted. Though attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness, and measure it as one of several bodily forms of capital asset see erotic capital, a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and sexual orientation. For example, a gay or lesbian person would typically find a person of the same sex to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A bisexual person would find either sex to be attractive. In addition, there are asexual people, who usually do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic. Interpersonal attraction includes factors such as physical or psychological similarity, familiarity or possessing a preponderance of common or familiar features, similarity, complementarity, reciprocal liking, and reinforcement. The ability of a person's physical and other qualities to create a sexual interest in others is the basis of their use in advertising, music video, pornography, film, and other visual media, as well as in modeling, sex work and other occupations. Legal issues Main articles: Family law, Divorce, Marriage, Human sexual activity § Legal issues, and Sex and the law Globally, laws regulate human sexuality in several ways, including criminalizing particular sexual behaviors, granting individuals the privacy or autonomy to make their own sexual decisions, protecting individuals with regard to equality and non-discrimination, recognizing and protecting other individual rights, as well as legislating matters regarding marriage and the family, and creating laws protecting individuals from violence, harassment, and persecution. In the United States, there are two fundamentally different approaches, applied in different states, regarding the way the law is used to attempt to govern a person's sexuality. The black letter approach to law focuses on the study of pre-existing legal precedent, and attempts to offer a clear framework of rules within which lawyers and others can work. In contrast, the socio-legal approach focuses more broadly on the relationship between the law and society, and offers a more contextualized view of the relationship between legal and social change. Issues regarding human sexuality and human sexual orientation came to the forefront in Western law in the latter half of the twentiecentury, as part of the gay liberation movement's encouragement of LGBT individuals to come out of the closet and engage with the legal system, primarily through courts. Therefore, many issues regarding human sexuality and the law are found in the opinions of the courts. Sexual privacy See also: Sexual and reproductive health and rights While the issue of privacy has been useful to sexual rights claims, some scholars have criticized its usefulness, saying that this perspective is too narrow and restrictive. The law is often slow to intervene in certain forms of coercive behavior that can limit individuals' control over their own sexuality such as female genital mutilation, forced marriages or lack of access to reproductive health care. Many of these injustices are often perpetuated wholly or in part by private individuals rather than state agents, and as a result, there is an ongoing debate about the extent of state responsibility to prevent harmful practices and to investigate such practices when they do occur. State intervention with regards to sexuality also occurs, and is considered acceptable by some, in certain instances e. g. same-sex sexual activity or prostitution. The legal systems surrounding prostitution are a topic of debate. Proponents for criminalization argue that sex work is an immoral practice that should not be tolerated, while proponents for decriminalization point out how criminalization does more harm than good. Within the feminist movement, there is also a debate over whether sex work is inherently objectifying and exploitative or whether sex workers have the agency to sell sex as a service. When sex work is criminalized, sex workers do not have support from law enforcement when they fall victim to violence. In a survey of street-based sex workers in NYC, said they had been threatened with or experienced violence, and many said the police were no help. said they had experienced violence from police officers themselves. Different identities such as being black, transgender, or poor can result in a person being more likely to be criminally profiled by the police. For example, in New York, there is a law against loitering for the purpose of engaging in prostitution, which has been nicknamed the walking while trans law because of how often transgender women are assumed to be sex workers and arrested for simply walking out in public. Religious sexual morality Main article: Religion and sexuality Further information: History of human sexuality In some religions, sexual behavior is regarded as primarily spiritual. In others it is treated as primarily physical. Some hold that sexual behavior is only spiritual within certain kinds of relationships, when used for specific purposes, or when incorporated into religious ritual. In some religions there are no distinctions between the physical and the spiritual, whereas some religions view human sexuality as a way of completing the gap that exists between the spiritual and the physical. Many religious conservatives, especially those of Abrahamic religions and Christianity in particular, tend to view sexuality in terms of behavior i. e. homosexuality or heterosexuality is what someone does and certain sexualities such as bisexuality tend to be ignored as a result of this. citation needed These conservatives tend to promote celibacy for gay people, and may also tend to believe that sexuality can be changed through conversion therapy or prayer to become an ex-gay. They may also see homosexuality as a form of mental illness, something that ought to be criminalised, an immoral abomination, caused by ineffective parenting, and view same-sex marriage as a threat to society. On the other hand, most religious liberals define sexuality-related labels in terms of sexual attraction and self-identification. They may also view same-sex activity as morally neutral and as legally acceptable as opposite-sex activity, unrelated to mental illness, genetically or environmentally caused but not as the result of bad parenting, and fixed. They also tend to be more in favor of same-sex marriage. Judaism According to Judaism, sex between man and woman within marriage is sacred and should be enjoyed; celibacy is considered sinful. Christianity Early Christianity Desire, including sexual desire and lust, were considered immoral and sinful, according to some authors. Elaine Pagels says, By the beginning of the fifcentury, Augustine had actually declared that spontaneous sexual desire is the proof of—and penalty for—universal original sin, though that this view goes against most of his Christian predecessors. According to Jennifer Wright Knust, Paul framed desire a force Christians gained control over whereas non-Christians were enslaved by it; and he also said the bodies of Christians were members of Christ's body and thus sexual desire must be eschewed. Roman Catholic Church The Roman Catholic Church teaches that sexuality is noble and worthy and has a unitive and procreative end. For this reason, sexual activity's ideal should occur in the context of a marriage between a man and a woman, and open to the possibility of life. Pope Francis teaches in Amoris laetitia against an attitude that would solve everything by applying general rules or deriving undue conclusions from particular theological considerations. and that he also warns that not all discussions of doctrinal, moral or pastoral issues need to be settled by interventions of the magisterium. and that We have been called to form consciences, not to replace them. The church has authoritative teachings on sexuality found in the catechism. The church places primacy of conscience especially on the regulation of births. Anglicanism The Anglican Church teaches that human sexuality is a gift from a loving God designed to be between a man and a woman in a monogamous lifetime union of marriage. It also views singleness and dedicated celibacy as Christ-like. It states that people with same sex attraction are loved by God and are welcomed as full members of the Body of Christ, while the Church leadership has a variety of views in regard to homosexual expression and ordination. Some expressions of sexuality are considered sinful including promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, paedophilia, predatory sexual behaviour, and sadomasochism all of which may be heterosexual and homosexual, adultery, violence against wives, and female circumcision. The Church is concerned with pressures on young people to engage sexually and encourages abstinence. Evangelicalism In matters of sexuality, several Evangelical churches promote the virginity pledge among young Evangelical Christians, who are invited to commit themselves during a public ceremony to sexual abstinence until Christian marriage. This pledge is often symbolized by a purity ring. In evangelical churches, young adults and unmarried couples are encouraged to marry early in order to live a sexuality according to the will of God. Although some churches are discreet on the subject, other evangelical churches in United States and Switzerland speak of a satisfying sexuality as a gift from God and a component of a harmonious Christian marriage, in messages during worship services or conferences. Many evangelical books and websites are specialized on the subject. The perceptions of homosexuality in the Evangelical Churches are varied. They range from liberal through moderate to conservative. Islam Main article: Sex in Islam In Islam, sexual desire is considered to be a natural urge that should not be suppressed, although the concept of free sex is not accepted; these urges should be fulfilled responsibly. Marriage is considered to be a good deed; it does not hinder spiritual wayfaring. The term used for marriage within the Quran is nikahcitation needed, which literally means sexual intercourse. Although Islamic sexuality is restrained via Islamic sexual jurisprudence, it emphasizes sexual pleasure within marriage. It is acceptable for a man to have more than one wife, but he must take care of those wives physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, and spiritually. Muslims believe that sexual intercourse is an act of worship that fulfils emotional and physical needs, and that producing children is one way in which humans can contribute to God's creation, and Islam discourages celibacy once an individual is married. However, homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam, and some Muslim lawyers have suggested that gay people should be put to death. On the other hand, some have argued that Islam has an open and playful approach to sex so long as it is within marriage, free of lewdness, fornication and adultery. For many Muslims, sex with reference to the Quran indicates that—bar anal intercourse and adultery—a Muslim marital home bonded by Nikah marital contract between husband and wife or wives should enjoy and even indulge, within the privacy of their marital home, in limitless scope of heterosexual sexual acts within a monogamous or polygamous marriage. unreliable source? Hinduism Hinduism emphasizes that sex is only appropriate between husband and wife, in which satisfying sexual urges through sexual pleasure is an important duty of marriage. Any sex before marriage is considered to interfere with intellectual development, especially between birth and the age of, which is said to be brahmacharya and this should be avoided. Kama sensual pleasures is one of the four purusharthas or aims of life dharma, artha, kama, and moksha. The Hindu Kama Sutra deals partially with sexual intercourse; it is not exclusively a sexual or religious work. Sikhism Sikhism views chastity as important, as Sikhs believe that the divine spark of Waheguru is present inside every individual's body, therefore it is important for one to keep clean and pure. Sexual activity is limited to married couples, and extramarital sex is forbidden. Marriage is seen as a commitment to Waheguru and should be viewed as part of spiritual companionship, rather than just sexual intercourse, and monogamy is deeply emphasised in Sikhism. Any other way of living is discouraged, including celibacy and homosexuality. However, in comparison to other religions, the issue of sexuality in Sikhism is not considered one of paramount importance. `
const comp = `A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations computation automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system main software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster. A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users. Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET MOS transistor and monolithic integrated circuit IC chip technologies in the late, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace as predicted by Moore's law, leading to the Digital Revolution during the late th to early st centuries. Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit CPU in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices keyboards, mice, joystick, etc., output devices monitor screens, printers, etc., and input/output devices that perform both functions e. g., the s-era touchscreen. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved. Etymology A human computer. A human computer, with microscope and calculator, According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known use of computer was in a book called The Yong Mans Gleanings by the English writer Richard Brathwait: I haue sic read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer sic breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number. This usage of the term referred to a human computer, a person who carried out calculations or computations. The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the century. During the latter part of this period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts. By, most human computers were women. The Online Etymology Dictionary gives the first attested use of computer in the, meaning 'one who calculates'; this is an agent noun from compute v The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the use of the term to mean 'calculating machine' of any type is from. The Online Etymology Dictionary indicates that the modern use of the term, to mean 'programmable digital electronic computer' dates from under this name; in a theoretical sense from, as Turing machine. History Main articles: History of computing hardware and History of computing Pre-century The Ishango bone, a bone tool dating back to prehistoric Africa. Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi clay spheres, cones, etc. which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers. a The use of counting rods is one example. The Chinese suanpan 算盘. The number represented on this abacus is, . The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in Babylonia as early as BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money. The Antikythera mechanism, dating back to ancient Greece circa – BC, is an early analog computing device. The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer, according to Derek J. de Solla Price. It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to approximately c.  BC. Devices of comparable complexity to the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until the fourteencentury. Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The planisphere was a star chart invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early century. The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the st or nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in. Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe, an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine with a gear train and gear-wheels, c.  AD. The sector, a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation. The planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage. A slide rule. The slide rule was invented around – by the English clergyman William Oughtred, shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm. It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions. Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations, such as the EB circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft. In the, Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker, built a mechanical doll automaton that could write holding a quill pen. By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically programmed to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, and still operates. In –, mathematician and engineer Giovanni Plana devised a Perpetual Calendar machine, which, through a system of pulleys and cylinders and over, could predict the perpetual calendar for every year from AD that is, BC to AD, keeping track of leap years and varying day length. The tide-predicting machine invented by the Scottish scientist Sir William Thomson in was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location. The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In, Sir William Thomson had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators. In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers. First computer A portion of Babbage's Difference engine. Charles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the father of the computer, he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early century. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete. The machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand – this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to political and financial difficulties as well as his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit the mill in. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in. Analog computers Main article: Analog computer Sir William Thomson's third tide-predicting machine design, – During the first half of the century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers. The first modern analog computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson later to become Lord Kelvin in. The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in by James Thomson, the elder brother of the more famous Sir William Thomson. The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer, built by H. L. Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT starting in. This built on the mechanical integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious. By the, the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remained in use during the s in some specialized applications such as education slide rule and aircraft control systems. Digital computers Electromechanical By, the United States Navy had developed an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a submarine. This was the Torpedo Data Computer, which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target. During World War II similar devices were developed in other countries as well. Replica of Konrad Zuse's Z, the first fully automatic, digital electromechanical computer. Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer. In, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the Z, the world's first working electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer. The Z was built with relays, implementing a bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about – Hz. Program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in words of memory or supplied from the keyboard. It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as floating-point numbers. Rather than the harder-to-implement decimal system used in Charles Babbage's earlier design, using a binary system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time. The Z was not itself a universal computer but could be extended to be Turing complete. Zuse's next computer, the Z, became the world's first commercial computer; after initial delay due to the Second World War, it was completed in and delivered to the ETH Zurich. The computer was manufactured by Zuse's own company, Zuse KG de, which was founded in as the first company with the sole purpose of developing computers. Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits Purely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog. The engineer Tommy Flowers, working at the Post Office Research Station in London in the, began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange. Experimental equipment that he built in went into operation five years later, converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of vacuum tubes. In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University developed and tested the Atanasoff–Berry Computer ABC in, the first automatic electronic digital computer. This design was also all-electronic and used about vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory. Two women are seen by the Colossus computer. Colossus, the first electronic digital programmable computing device, was used to break German ciphers during World War II. It is seen here in use at Bletchley Park in. During World War II, the British code-breakers at Bletchley Park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications. The German encryption machine, Enigma, was first attacked with the help of the electro-mechanical bombes which were often run by women. To crack the more sophisticated German Lorenz SZ / machine, used for high-level Army communications, Max Newman and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus. He spent eleven months from early February designing and building the first Colossus. After a functional test in December, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on January and attacked its first message on February. Colossus was the world's first electronic digital programmable computer. It used a large number of valves vacuum tubes. It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data, but it was not Turing-complete. Nine Mk II Colossi were built The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total. Colossus Mark I contained, thermionic valves tubes, but Mark II with, valves, was both five times faster and simpler to operate than Mark I, greatly speeding the decoding process. ENIAC was the first electronic, Turing-complete device, and performed ballistics trajectory calculations for the United States Army. The ENIAC Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was the first electronic programmable computer built in the U. S. Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus, it was much faster, more flexible, and it was Turing-complete. Like the Colossus, a program on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later. Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches. The programmers of the ENIAC were six women, often known collectively as the ENIAC girls. It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to words about bytes. Built under the direction of John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from to full operation at the end of. The machine was huge, weighing tons, using kilowatts of electric power and contained over, vacuum tubes, relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Modern computers Concept of modern computer The principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his seminal paper, On Computable Numbers. Turing proposed a simple device that he called Universal Computing machine and that is now known as a universal Turing machine. He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions program stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the stored program, where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper. Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine. Stored programs Main article: Stored-program computer Three tall racks containing electronic circuit boards A section of the Manchester Baby, the first electronic stored-program computer Early computing machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine. With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions a program that details the computation. The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by Alan Turing in his paper. In, Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer. His report Proposed Electronic Calculator was the first specification for such a device. John von Neumann at the University of Pennsylvania also circulated his First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC in. The Manchester Baby was the world's first stored-program computer. It was built at the University of Manchester in England by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill, and ran its first program on June. It was designed as a testbed for the Williams tube, the first random-access digital storage device. Although the computer was considered small and primitive by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer. As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the Manchester Mark. Grace Hopper was the first person to develop a compiler for programming language. The Mark in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti Mark, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer. Built by Ferranti, it was delivered to the University of Manchester in February. At least seven of these later machines were delivered between and, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam. In October, the directors of British catering company J. Lyons and Company decided to take an active role in promoting the commercial development of computers. The LEO I computer became operational in April and ran the world's first regular routine office computer job. Transistors Main articles: Transistor and History of the transistor Further information: Transistor computer and MOSFET Bipolar junction transistor BJT The concept of a field-effect transistor was proposed by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in. John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs, built the first working transistor, the point-contact transistor, in, which was followed by Shockley's bipolar junction transistor in. From onwards, transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the second generation of computers. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space. However, early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, which limited them to a number of specialised applications. At the University of Manchester, a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves. Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by, and a second version was completed there in April. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorized computer. That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of, built by the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. MOSFET MOS transistor, showing gate G, body B, source and drain D terminals. The gate is separated from the body by an insulating layer pink. The metal–oxide–silicon field-effect transistor MOSFET, also known as the MOS transistor, was invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in. It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses. With its high scalability, and much lower power consumption and higher density than bipolar junction transistors, the MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuits. In addition to data processing, it also enabled the practical use of MOS transistors as memory cell storage elements, leading to the development of MOS semiconductor memory, which replaced earlier magnetic-core memory in computers. The MOSFET led to the microcomputer revolution, and became the driving force behind the computer revolution. The MOSFET is the most widely used transistor in computers, and is the fundamental building block of digital electronics. Integrated circuits Main articles: Integrated circuit and Invention of the integrated circuit Further information: Planar process and Microprocessor The next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the integrated circuit IC. The idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment of the Ministry of Defence, Geoffrey W. A. Dummer. Dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in Washington, D. C. on May. The first working ICs were invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor. Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on September. In his patent application of February, Kilby described his new device as a body of semiconductor material,wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated. However, Kilby's invention was a hybrid integrated circuit hybrid IC, rather than a monolithic integrated circuit IC chip. Kilby's IC had external wire connections, which made it difficult to mass-produce. Noyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby. Noyce's invention was the first true monolithic IC chip. His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor, it was made of silicon, whereas Kilby's chip was made of germanium. Noyce's monolithic IC was fabricated using the planar process, developed by his colleague Jean Hoerni in early. In turn, the planar process was based on Mohamed M. Atalla's work on semiconductor surface passivation by silicon dioxide in the late s. Modern monolithic ICs are predominantly MOS metal-oxide-semiconductor integrated circuits, built from MOSFETs MOS transistors. The earliest experimental MOS IC to be fabricated was a -transistor chip built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in. General Microelectronics later introduced the first commercial MOS IC in, developed by Robert Norman. Following the development of the self-aligned gate silicon-gate MOS transistor by Robert Kerwin, Donald Klein and John Sarace at Bell Labs in, the first silicon-gate MOS IC with self-aligned gates was developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild Semiconductor in. The MOSFET has since become the most critical device component in modern ICs. The development of the MOS integrated circuit led to the invention of the microprocessor, and heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers. While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term microprocessor, it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel, designed and realized by Federico Faggin with his silicon-gate MOS IC technology, along with Ted Hoff, Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel. b In the early, MOS IC technology enabled the integration of more than, transistors on a single chip. System on a Chip SoCs are complete computers on a microchip or chip the size of a coin. They may or may not have integrated RAM and flash memory. If not integrated, the RAM is usually placed directly above known as Package on package or below on the opposite side of the circuit board the SoC, and the flash memory is usually placed right next to the SoC, this all done to improve data transfer speeds, as the data signals don't have to travel long distances. Since ENIAC in, computers have advanced enormously, with modern SoCs Such as the Snapdragon being the size of a coin while also being hundreds of thousands of times more powerful than ENIAC, integrating billions of transistors, and consuming only a few watts of power. Mobile computers The first mobile computers were heavy and ran from mains power. The lb kg IBM was an early example. Later portables such as the Osborne and Compaq Portable were considerably lighter but still needed to be plugged in. The first laptops, such as the Grid Compass, removed this requirement by incorporating batteries – and with the continued miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the s. The same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular mobile phones by the early s. These smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and recently became the dominant computing device on the market. These are powered by System on a Chip SoCs, which are complete computers on a microchip the size of a coin. `
const program = `A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical program elements in the case of visual programming languages, to various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Since the early, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos. The programs for these machines such as a player piano's scrolls did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions. Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form i. e., as a sequence of operations to perform while other languages use the declarative form i. e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it. The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax form and semantics meaning, which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document for example, the programming language is specified by an ISO Standard while other languages such as Perl have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common. Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages. Definitions A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm. Some authors restrict the term programming language to those languages that can express all possible algorithms. Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language include: Function and target A computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs, which involves a computer performing some kind of computation or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers, disk drives, robots, and so on. For example, PostScript programs are frequently created by another program to control a computer printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some, possibly abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language. In most practical contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined and studied this way. Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines. Abstractions Programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle. This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions. Expressive power The theory of computation classifies languages by the computations they are capable of expressing. All Turing-complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL- and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet are often called programming languages. Markup languages like XML, HTML, or troff, which define structured data, are not usually considered programming languages. Programming languages may, however, share the syntax with markup languages if a computational semantics is defined. XSLT, for example, is a Turing complete language entirely using XML syntax. Moreover, LaTeX, which is mostly used for structuring documents, also contains a Turing complete subset. The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language. However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages. Similarly, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming. Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines, and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources. John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats. History Main article: History of programming languages Early developments Very early computers, such as Colossus, were programmed without the help of a stored program, by modifying their circuitry or setting banks of physical controls. Slightly later, programs could be written in machine language, where the programmer writes each instruction in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly. For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory locations might consist of numbers: an opcode that selects the add operation, and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from punched cards, paper tape, magnetic tape or toggled in on switches on the front panel of the computer. Machine languages were later termed first-generation programming languages GL. The next step was the development of the so-called second-generation programming languages GL or assembly languages, which were still closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations. The first high-level programming languages, or third-generation programming languages GL, were written in the s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalkül, developed for the German Z by Konrad Zuse between and. However, it was not implemented until and. John Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer. Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code. At the University of Manchester, Alick Glennie developed Autocode in the early s. As a programming language, it used a compiler to automatically convert the language into machine code. The first code and compiler was developed in for the Mark computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first compiled high-level programming language. The second autocode was developed for the Mark by R. A. Brooker in and was called the Mark Autocode. Brooker also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. The version for the EDSAC was devised by D. F. Hartley of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in. Known as EDSAC Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development, Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas machine. In, FORTRAN was invented at IBM by John Backus. It was the first widely used high-level general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper. It is still a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers. Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC. It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from until. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early, she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and implemented a prototype. The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early and was substantially complete in. FLOW-MATIC was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendant AIMACO were in actual use at the time. Refinement The increased use of high-level languages introduced a requirement for low-level programming languages or system programming languages. These languages, to varying degrees, provide facilities between assembly languages and high-level languages. They can be used to perform tasks that require direct access to hardware facilities but still provide higher-level control structures and error-checking. The period from the s to the late s brought the development of the major language paradigms now in use: APL introduced array programming and influenced functional programming. ALGOL refined both structured procedural programming and the discipline of language specification; the Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL became a model for how later language specifications were written. Lisp, implemented in, was the first dynamically typed functional programming language. In the, Simula was the first language designed to support object-oriented programming; in the mid-s, Smalltalk followed with the first purely object-oriented language. was developed between and as a system programming language for the Unix operating system and remains popular. Prolog, designed in, was the first logic programming language. In, ML built a polymorphic type system on top of Lisp, pioneering statically typed functional programming languages. Each of these languages spawned descendants, and most modern programming languages count at least one of them in their ancestry. The s and s also saw considerable debate over the merits of structured programming, and whether programming languages should be designed to support it. Edsger Dijkstra, in a famous letter published in the Communications of the ACM, argued that Goto statements should be eliminated from all higher level programming languages. Consolidation and growth A selection of textbooks that teach programming, in languages both popular and obscure. These are only a few of the thousands of programming languages and dialects that have been designed in history. The s were years of relative consolidation. C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized Ada, a systems programming language derived from Pascal and intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating the so-called fifth-generation languages that incorporated logic programming constructs. The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decades. One important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the s was an increased focus on the use of modules or large-scale organizational units of code. Modula, Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the, which were often wedded to generic programming constructs. The rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-s created opportunities for new languages. Perl, originally a Unix scripting tool first released in, became common in dynamic websites. Java came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of Write once, run anywhere UCSD Pascal had been popular for a time in the early s. These developments were not fundamentally novel; rather, they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms although their syntax was often based on the family of programming languages. Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Current directions include security and reliability verification, new kinds of modularity mixins, delegates, aspects, and database integration such as Microsoft's LINQ. Fourth-generation programming languages GL are computer programming languages that aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than GLs. Fifth-generation programming languages GL are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an algorithm written by a programmer. Elements All programming languages have some primitive building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection. These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively. Syntax Main article: Syntax programming languages Parse tree of Python code with inset tokenization Syntax highlighting is often used to aid programmers in recognizing elements of source code. The language above is Python. A programming language's surface form is known as its syntax. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program. The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics either formal or hard-coded in a reference implementation. Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax. Programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions for lexical structure and Backus–Naur form for grammatical structure. Below is a simple grammar, based on Lisp: expression ::= atom | list atom ::= number | symbol number ::= +-?''-''+ symbol ::= 'A'-'Z''a'-'z'.* list ::= '' expression* '' This grammar specifies the following: an expression is either an atom or a list; an atom is either a number or a symbol; a number is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign; a symbol is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters excluding whitespace; and a list is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more expressions inside it. The following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar:, and a b c. Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit undefined behavior. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it. Using natural language as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false: Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning. John is a married bachelor. is grammatically well-formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be true. The following language fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined the operation; If the type declaration on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on undefined variable p during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information. The grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the Chomsky hierarchy. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type- grammar, i.e., they are context-free grammars. Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase. Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an undecidable problem, and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution. In contrast to Lisp's macro system and Perl's BEGIN blocks, which may contain general computations, macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution. Semantics The term semantics refers to the meaning of languages, as opposed to their form syntax. Static semantics The static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms. For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time. Examples include checking that every identifier is declared before it is used in languages that require such declarations or that the labels on the arms of a case statement are distinct. Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context e. g. not adding an integer to a function name, or that subroutine calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a logic called a type system. Other forms of static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part of static semantics. Newer programming languages like Java and C# have definite assignment analysis, a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics. Dynamic semantics Main article: Semantics of programming languages Once data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the strategy by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which control structures conditionally execute statements. The dynamic semantics also known as execution semantics of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research went into formal semantics of programming languages, which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia. Type system Main articles: Data type, Type system, and Type safety A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types, how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Any decidable type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have type loopholes, usually unchecked casts that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to type check programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, infer types, relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as type theory. Typed versus untyped languages A language is typed if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable. For example, the data represented by this text between the quotes is a string, and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed. The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled static type checking and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected while the program is running dynamic type checking, resulting in a run-time exception. Many languages allow a function called an exception handler to handle this exception and, for example, always return - as the result. A special case of typed languages are the single-typed languages. These are often scripting or markup languages, such as REXX or SGML, and have only one data typedubious – discuss–—most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data. In contrast, an untyped language, such as most assembly languages, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally sequences of bits of various lengths. High-level untyped languages include BCPL, Tcl, and some varieties of Forth. In practice, while few languages are considered typed from the type theory verifying or rejecting all operations, most modern languages offer a degree of typing. Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system, trading type-safety for finer control over the program's execution see casting. Static versus dynamic typing In static typing, all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed, typically at compile-time. For example, and + are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string, or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates. Statically typed languages can be either manifestly typed or type-inferred. In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions for example, at variable declarations. In the second case, the compiler infers the types of expressions and declarations based on context. Most mainstream statically typed languages, such as C++, C# and Java, are manifestly typed. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages, such as Haskell and ML. However, many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference; for example, C++, Java and C# all infer types in certain limited cases. Additionally, some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types; for example, an int can be used where the program expects a float. Dynamic typing, also called latent typing, determines the type-safety of operations at run time; in other words, types are associated with run-time values rather than textual expressions. As with type-inferred languages, dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions. Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution. However, type errors cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, potentially making debugging more difficult. Lisp, Smalltalk, Perl, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are all examples of dynamically typed languages. Weak and strong typing Weak typing allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a string as a number. This can occasionally be useful, but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at compile time and even at run time. Strong typing prevents these program faults. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error. Strongly typed languages are often termed type-safe or safe. An alternative definition for weakly typed refers to languages, such as Perl and JavaScript, which permit a large number of implicit type conversions. In JavaScript, for example, the expression * x implicitly converts x to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if x is null, undefined, an Array, or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors. Strong and static are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term strongly typed to mean strongly, statically typed, or, even more confusingly, to mean simply statically typed. Thus has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed. It may seem odd to some professional programmers that could be weakly, statically typed. However, notice that the use of the generic pointer, the void* pointer, does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast. This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in without using an explicit cast, such as int or char. Standard library and run-time system Main article: Standard library Most programming languages have an associated core library sometimes known as the 'standard library', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard, which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output. The line between a language and its core library differs from language to language. In some cases, the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language. However, a language's core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations. Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library. For example, in Java, a string literal is defined as an instance of the java. lang. String class; similarly, in Smalltalk, an anonymous function expression a block constructs an instance of the library's BlockContext class. Conversely, Scheme contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library. Design and implementation Programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing language families of related languages branching one from another. But as artificial constructs, they also differ in fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage. A significant difference is that a programming language can be fully described and studied in its entirety since it has a precise and finite definition. By contrast, natural languages have changing meanings given by their users in different communities. While constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has. Many programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one universal programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role. The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used: Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of programmers. Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity. Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from microcontrollers to supercomputers. Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification. Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language. One common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of abstraction. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets them write more functionality per time unit. Natural language programming has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming. However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate. Edsger W. Dijkstra took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs, and dismissed natural language programming as foolish. Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea. Hybrid approaches have been taken in Structured English and SQL. A language's designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of programming. The most important of these artifacts are the language specification and implementation. Specification Main article: Programming language specification The specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language, and if so what its behavior shall be. A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following: An explicit definition of the syntax, static semantics, and execution semantics of the language. While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in natural language e. g., as in the language, or a formal semantics e. g., as in Standard ML and Scheme specifications. A description of the behavior of a translator for the language e. g., the C++ and Fortran specifications. The syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description, which may be written in natural or a formal language. A reference or model implementation, sometimes written in the language being specified e. g., Prolog or ANSI REXX. The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation. Implementation Main article: Programming language implementation An implementation of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software. There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation: compilation and interpretation. It is generally possible to implement a language using either technique. The output of a compiler may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter. In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting. For instance, some implementations of BASIC compile and then execute the source a line at a time. Programs that are executed directly on the hardware usually run much faster than those that are interpreted in software. better source needed One technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is just-in-time compilation. Here the virtual machine, just before execution, translates the blocks of bytecode which are going to be used to machine code, for direct execution on the hardware. Proprietary languages Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly domain specific languages or internal scripting languages for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users. Some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, Oracle Corporation asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the Java programming language, and Microsoft's C# programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has Common Language Runtime CLR as a closed environment. Many proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include MATLAB, VBScript, and Wolfram Language. Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example, Erlang was originally an Ericsson's internal programming language. Use Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field. Individual software projects commonly use five programming languages or more. Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers do exactly what they are told to do, and cannot understand what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode, which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language. A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A programmer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available called primitives. Programming is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment. Programs for a computer might be executed in a batch process without human interaction, or a user might type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter. In this case the commands are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its commands through an interpreter such as a Unix shell or other command-line interface, without compiling, it is called a scripting language. Measuring language usage Main article: Measuring programming language popularity Determining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one has more lines of code, and a third may consume the most CPU time. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example, COBOL is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large mainframes; Fortran in scientific and engineering applications; Ada in aerospace, transportation, military, real-time and embedded applications; and in embedded applications and operating systems. Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications. Various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language the number of books sold that teach or describe the language estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language – which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches counts of language references i. e., to the name of the language found using a web search engine. Combining and averaging information from various internet sites, stackify. com reported the ten most popular programming languages as in descending order by overall popularity: Java, C, C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, VB. NET, R, PHP, and MATLAB. Dialects, flavors and implementations A dialect of a programming language or a data exchange language is a relatively small variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature. With languages such as Scheme and Forth, standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new dialect. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a domain-specific language, often a subset. In the Lisp world, most languages that use basic S-expression syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly, as do, say, Racket and Clojure. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The BASIC programming language has many dialects. The explosion of Forth dialects led to the saying If you've seen one Forth. you've seen one Forth. Taxonomies Further information: Categorical list of programming languages There is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages. A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language. Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time. Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family. The task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes. For example, Java is both an object-oriented language because it encourages object-oriented organization and a concurrent language because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple threads in parallel. Python is an object-oriented scripting language. In broad strokes, programming languages divide into programming paradigms and a classification by intended domain of use, with general-purpose programming languages distinguished from domain-specific programming languages. Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands. These are generally called imperative programming languages. A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of declarative programming. More refined paradigms include procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and logic programming; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic. An assembly language is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture. By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose, system programming languages, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages or a combination of these. Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals. A programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm. For instance, most programming languages use English language keywords, while a minority do not. Other languages may be classified as being deliberately esoteric or not. `
const love = `Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure. An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment. additional citations needed Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency. It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals. In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts. Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species. Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love in Greek, Storge, friendly love or platonic love Philia, romantic love Eros, self-love Philautia, guest love Xenia, and divine love Agape. Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love. Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafuné, Kama, Bhakti, Mettā, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, Charity, Saudade and other variants or symbioses of these states, as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of love in regards to a specified moments currently lacking in the English language. Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades. The color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel. The triangular theory of love suggests intimacy, passion and commitment are core components of love. Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning. This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states. Definitions Romeo and Juliet, depicted as they part on the balcony in Act III, by Ford Madox Brown The word love can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Many other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that in English are denoted as love; one example is the plurality of Greek concepts for love agape, eros, philia, storge. Cultural differences in conceptualizing love thus doubly impede the establishment of a universal definition. Although the nature or essence of love is a subject of frequent debate, different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what isn't love antonyms of love. Love as a general expression of positive sentiment a stronger form of like is commonly contrasted with hate or neutral apathy. As a less-sexual and more-emotionally intimate form of romantic attachment, love is commonly contrasted with lust. As an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is sometimes contrasted with friendship, although the word love is often applied to close friendships or platonic love. Further possible ambiguities come with usages girlfriend, boyfriend, just good friends. Fraternal love Prehispanic sculpture from to AD, of Huastec origin. Museum of Anthropology in Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico Abstractly discussed, love usually refers to an experience one person feels for another. Love often involves caring for, or identifying with, a person or thing cf. vulnerability and care theory of love, including oneself cf. narcissism. In addition to cross-cultural differences in understanding love, ideas about love have also changed greatly over time. Some historians date modern conceptions of romantic love to courtly Europe during or after the Middle Ages, although the prior existence of romantic attachments is attested by ancient love poetry. The complex and abstract nature of love often reduces discourse of love to a thought-terminating cliché. Several common proverbs regard love, from Virgil's Love conquers all to The Beatles' All You Need Is Love. St. Thomas Aquinas, following Aristotle, defines love as to will the good of another. Bertrand Russell describes love as a condition of absolute value, as opposed to relative value. citation needed Philosopher Gottfried Leibniz said that love is to be delighted by the happiness of another. Meher Baba stated that in love there is a feeling of unity and an active appreciation of the intrinsic worth of the object of love. Biologist Jeremy Griffith defines love as unconditional selflessness. Impersonal People can be said to love an object, principle, or goal to which they are deeply committed and greatly value. For example, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' love of their cause may sometimes be born not of interpersonal love but impersonal love, altruism, and strong spiritual or political convictions. People can also love material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding or otherwise identifying with those things. If sexual passion is also involved, then this feeling is called paraphilia.

It is a much more potent sentiment than a simple liking for a person. Unrequited love refers to those feelings of love that are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with Interpersonal relationships. Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples. There are also a number of psychological disorders related to love, such as erotomania. Throughout history, philosophy and religion have done the most speculation on the phenomenon of love. In the century, the science of psychology has written a great deal on the subject. In recent years, the sciences of psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, and biology have added to the understanding of the concept of love. Biological basis Main article: Biological basis of love Biological models of sex tend to view love as a mammalian drive, much like hunger or thirst. Helen Fisher, an anthropologist and human behavior researcher, divides the experience of love into three partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust is the feeling of sexual desire; romantic attraction determines what partners mates find attractive and pursue, conserving time and energy by choosing; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental duties, mutual defense, and in humans involves feelings of safety and security. Three distinct neural circuitries, including neurotransmitters, and three behavioral patterns, are associated with these three romantic styles. Pair of Lovers. – Lust is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes mating, and involves the increased release of chemicals such as testosterone and estrogen. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months. Attraction is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in neuroscience have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including the neurotransmitter hormones, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, the same compounds released by amphetamine, stimulating the brain's pleasure center and leading to side effects such as increased heart rate, loss of appetite and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years. Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. Attachment is the bonding that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as marriage and children, or mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals oxytocin and vasopressin to a greater degree than short-term relationships have. Enzo Emanuele and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the nerve growth factor NGF has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year. Psychological basis Further information: Human bonding Grandmother and grandchild in Sri Lanka Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. Psychologist Robert Sternberg formulated a triangular theory of love and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three components. American psychologist Zick Rubin sought to define love by psychometrics in the s. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy. Following developments in electrical theories such as Coulomb's law, which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as opposites attract. Over the last century, research on the nature of human mating has generally found this not to be true when it comes to character and personality—people tend to like people similar to themselves. However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as immune systems, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike themselves e. g., with an orthogonal immune system, since this will lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds. In recent years, various human bonding theories have been developed, described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities. Some Western authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic. This view is represented in the works of Scott Peck, whose work in the field of applied psychology explored the definitions of love and evil. Peck maintains that love is a combination of the concern for the spiritual growth of another, and simple narcissism. In combination, love is an activity, not simply a feeling. Psychologist Erich Fromm maintained in his book The Art of Loving that love is not merely a feeling but is also actions, and that in fact, the feeling of love is superficial in comparison to one's commitment to love via a series of loving actions over time. In this sense, Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but rather is a commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards another, oneself, or many others, over a sustained duration. Fromm also described love as a conscious choice that in its early stages might originate as an involuntary feeling, but which then later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only on conscious commitment. Evolutionary basis Wall of Love on Montmartre in Paris: I love you in languages, by calligraphist Fédéric Baron and artist Claire Kito Evolutionary psychology has attempted to provide various reasons for love as a survival tool. Humans are dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans compared to other mammals. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period. Furthermore, researchers as early as Charles Darwin himself identified unique features of human love compared to other mammals and credit love as a major factor for creating social support systems that enabled the development and expansion of the human species. Another factor may be that sexually transmitted diseases can cause, among other effects, permanently reduced fertility, injury to the fetus, and increase complications during childbirth. This would favor monogamous relationships over polygamy. Adaptive benefit Interpersonal love between a male and a female is considered to provide an evolutionary adaptive benefit since it facilitates mating and sexual reproduction. However, some organisms can reproduce asexually without mating. Thus understanding the adaptive benefit of interpersonal love depends on understanding the adaptive benefit of sexual reproduction as opposed to asexual reproduction. Michod has reviewed evidence that love, and consequently sexual reproduction, provides two major adaptive advantages. First, love leading to sexual reproduction facilitates repair of damages in the DNA that is passed from parent to progeny during meiosis, a key stage of the sexual process. Second, a gene in either parent may contain a harmful mutation, but in the progeny produced by sex reproduction, expression of a harmful mutation introduced by one parent is likely to be masked by expression of the unaffected homologous gene from the other parent. Comparison of scientific models Biological models of love tend to see it as a mammalian drive, similar to hunger or thirst. Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Certainly, love is influenced by hormones such as oxytocin, neurotrophins such as NGF, and pheromones, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by their conceptions of love. The conventional view in biology is that there are two major drives in love: sexual attraction and attachment. Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a combination of companionate love and passionate love. Passionate love is intense longing, and is often accompanied by physiological arousal shortness of breath, rapid heart rate; companionate love is affection and a feeling of intimacy not accompanied by physiological arousal. Cultural views Ancient Greek See also: Greek words for love Roman copy of a Greek sculpture by Lysippus depicting Eros, the Greek personification of romantic love Greek distinguishes several different senses in which the word love is used. Ancient Greeks identified four forms of love: kinship or familiarity in Greek, storge, friendship and/or platonic desire philia, sexual and/or romantic desire eros, and self-emptying or divine love agape. Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of romantic love. However, with Greek as with many other languages, it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the Bible has examples of the verb agapo having the same meaning as phileo. Agape ἀγάπη agápē means love in modern-day Greek. The term s'agapo means I love you in Greek. The word agapo is the verb I love. It generally refers to a pure, ideal type of love, rather than the physical attraction suggested by eros. However, there are some examples of agape used to mean the same as eros. It has also been translated as love of the soul. Eros ἔρως érōs from the Greek deity Eros is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Greek word erota means in love. Plato refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. Some translations list it as love of the body. Philia φιλία philía, a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept addressed and developed by Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics Book VIII. It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. Philia is motivated by practical reasons; one or both of the parties benefit from the relationship. It can also mean love of the mind. Storge is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring. It was an almost ritualized friendship formed between a host and his guest, who could previously have been strangers. The host fed and provided quarters for the guest, who was expected to repay only with gratitude. The importance of this can be seen throughout Greek mythology—in particular, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. Ancient Roman Latin The Latin language has several different verbs corresponding to the English word love. amō is the basic verb meaning I love, with the infinitive amare to love as it still is in Italian today. The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come amans—a lover, amator, professional lover, often with the accessory notion of lechery—and amica, girlfriend in the English sense, often being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is amor the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the city, Rome—in Latin: Roma—can be viewed as an anagram for amor, which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times, which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces amicus—friend—and amicitia, friendship often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to indebtedness or influence. Cicero wrote a treatise called On Friendship de Amicitia, which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called Ars Amatoria The Art of Love, which addresses, in depth, everything from extramarital affairs to overprotective parents. Latin sometimes uses amāre where English would simply say to like. This notion, however, is much more generally expressed in Latin by the terms placere or delectāre, which are used more colloquially, the latter used frequently in the love poetry of Catullus. Diligere often has the notion to be affectionate for, to esteem, and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun diligentia, however, has the meaning of diligence or carefulness, and has little semantic overlap with the verb. Observare is a synonym for diligere; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, observantia, often denote esteem or affection. Caritas is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean charitable love; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan Roman literature. As it arises from a conflation with a Greek word, there is no corresponding verb. Chinese and other Sinic 愛 Mandarin: ài, the traditional Chinese character for love contains a heart 心 in the middle. Two philosophical underpinnings of love exist in the Chinese tradition, one from Confucianism which emphasized actions and duty while the other came from Mohism which championed a universal love. A core concept to Confucianism is 仁 Ren, benevolent love, which focuses on duty, action, and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself. In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as filial piety from children, kindness from parents, loyalty to the king and so forth. The concept of 愛 Mandarin: ài was developed by the Chinese philosopher Mozi in the century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love. Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of universal love 兼愛, jiān'ài. In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally. Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation; not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations. Later in Chinese Buddhism, the term Ai 愛 was adopted to refer to a passionate, caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, Ai was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment. In Mandarin Chinese, 愛 ài is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love. 愛 ài is used as both a verb e. g. 我愛你, Wǒ ài nǐ, or I love you and a noun such as 愛情 àiqíng, or romantic love. However, due to the influence of Confucian 仁 rén, the phrase 我愛你 Wǒ ài nǐ, I love you carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying I love you as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way. Consequently, I like you 我喜欢你, Wǒ xǐhuan nǐ is a more common way of expressing affection in Mandarin; it is more playful and less serious. This is also true in Japanese suki da, 好きだ. Japanese The Japanese language uses three words to convey the English equivalent of love. Because love covers a wide range of emotions and behavioral phenomena, there are nuances distinguishing the three terms. The term ai 愛, which is often associated with maternal love or selfless love, originally referred to beauty and was often used in a religious context. Following the Meiji Restoration, the term became associated with love in order to translate Western literature. Prior to Western influence, the term koi 恋 or 孤悲 generally represented romantic love, and was often the subject of the popular Man'yōshū Japanese poetry collection. Koi describes a longing for a member of the opposite sex and is typically interpreted as selfish and wanting. The term's origins come from the concept of lonely solitude as a result of separation from a loved one. Though modern usage of koi focuses on sexual love and infatuation, the Manyō used the term to cover a wider range of situations, including tenderness, benevolence, and material desire. The third term, ren'ai 恋愛, is a more modern construction that combines the kanji characters for both ai and koi, though its usage more closely resembles that of koi in the form of romantic love. Indian The love stories of the Hindu deities Krishna and Radha have influenced the Indian culture and arts. Above: Radha Madhavam by Raja Ravi Varma. In contemporary literature, the Sanskrit words for love is sneha. Other terms such as Priya refers to innocent love, Prema refers to spiritual love, and Kama refers usually to sexual desire. However, the term also refers to any sensory enjoyment, emotional attraction and aesthetic pleasure such as from arts, dance, music, painting, sculpture and nature. The concept of kama is found in some of the earliest known verses in Vedas. For example, Book of Rig Veda describes the creation of the universe from nothing by the great heat. There in hymn, it states: कामस्तदग्रे समवर्तताधि मनसो रेतः परथमं यदासीत | सतो बन्धुमसति निरविन्दन हर्दि परतीष्याकवयो मनीषा || Thereafter rose Desire in the beginning, Desire the primal seed and germ of Spirit, Sages who searched with their heart's thought discovered the existent's kinship in the non-existent. — Rig Veda, ~ century BC Persian The children of Adam are limbs of one body Having been created of one essence. When the calamity of time afflicts one limb The other limbs cannot remain at rest. If you have no sympathy for the troubles of others You are not worthy to be called by the name of man. Sa'di, Gulistan Rumi, Hafiz, and Sa'di are icons of the passion and love that the Persian culture and language present. citation needed The Persian word for love is Ishq, which is derived from Arabic language; however, it is considered by most to be too stalwart a term for interpersonal love and is more commonly substituted for doost dashtan liking. citation needed In the Persian culture, everything is encompassed by love and all is for love, starting from loving friends and family, husbands and wives, and eventually reaching the divine love that is the ultimate goal in life. citation needed Religious views Main article: Religious views on love Abrahamic Robert Indiana's Love sculpture spelling ahava Judaism See also: Jewish views on love In Hebrew, אהבה ahava is the most commonly used term for both interpersonal love and love between God and God's creations. Chesed, often translated as loving-kindness, is used to describe many forms of love between human beings. The commandment to love other people is given in the Torah, which states, Love your neighbor like yourself Leviticus :. The Torah's commandment to love God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might Deuteronomy : is taken by the Mishnah a central text of the Jewish oral law to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity tractate Berachoth :. Rabbinic literature differs as to how this love can be developed, e. g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: See life with the wife you love Ecclesiastes :. Rabbi David Wolpe writes that,love is not only about the feelings of the lover. It is when one person believes in another person and shows it. He further states that,love. is a feeling that expresses itself in action. What we really feel is reflected in what we do. The biblical book Song of Solomon is considered a romantically phrased metaphor of love between God and his people, but in its plain reading, reads like a love song. The th-century rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler is frequently quoted as defining love from the Jewish point of view as giving without expecting to take from his Michtav me-Eliyahu, Vol Christianity Love and not a one-way street in romanticism The Christian understanding is that love comes from God, who is himself Love Jn :. The love of man and woman—eros in Greek—and the unselfish love of others agape, are often contrasted as descending and ascending love, respectively, but are ultimately the same thing. There are several Greek words for love that are regularly referred to in Christian circles. Agape: In the New Testament, agapē is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love, seen as creating goodness in the world; it is the way God is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for one another. Phileo: Also used in the New Testament, phileo is a human response to something that is found to be delightful. Also known as brotherly love. Two other words for love in the Greek language, eros sexual love and storge child-to-parent love, were never used in the New Testament. Christians believe that to Love God with all your heart, mind, and strength and Love your neighbor as yourself are the two most important things in life the greatest commandment of the Jewish Torah, according to Jesus; cf. Gospel of Mark chapter, verses –. Saint Augustine summarized this when he wrote Love God, and do as thou wilt. The Apostle Paul glorified love as the most important virtue of all. Describing love in the famous poetic interpretation in Corinthians, he wrote, Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres. Cor. :–, NIV The Apostle John wrote, For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. John :–, NIV John also wrote, Dear friends, let us love one another for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. John :–, NIV Saint Augustine wrote that one must be able to decipher the difference between love and lust. Lust, according to Saint Augustine, is an overindulgence, but to love and be loved is what he has sought for his entire life. He even says, I was in love with love. Finally, he does fall in love and is loved back, by God. Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God, because love with a human only allows for flaws such as jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention. According to Saint Augustine, to love God is to attain the peace which is yours. Saint Augustine's Confessions Augustine regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew as the heart of Christian faith and the interpretation of the Bible. After the review of Christian doctrine, Augustine treats the problem of love in terms of use and enjoyment until the end of Book I of De Doctrina Christiana,Christian theologians see God as the source of love, which is mirrored in humans and their own loving relationships. Influential Christian theologian C. S. Lewis wrote a book called The Four Loves. Benedict XVI named his first encyclical God is love. He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others agape and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation eros. This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as Teresa of Calcutta and Mary, the mother of Jesus and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them. Pope Francis taught that True love is both loving and letting oneself be loved. what is important in love is not our loving, but allowing ourselves to be loved by God. And so, in the analysis of a Catholic theologian, for Pope Francis, the key to love. is not our activity. It is the activity of the greatest, and the source, of all the powers in the universe: God's. In Christianity the practical definition of love is summarised by Thomas Aquinas, who defined love as to will the good of another, or to desire for another to succeed. This is an explanation of the Christian need to love others, including their enemies. As Thomas Aquinas explains, Christian love is motivated by the need to see others succeed in life, to be good people. Regarding love for enemies, Jesus is quoted in the Gospel of Matthew chapter five: You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. – Matthew : –. Do not forget to love with forgiveness, Christ saved an adulterous woman from those who would stone her. A world of wronged hypocrites needs forgiving love. Mosaic Law would hold Deuteronomy :- If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then both of them shall die—the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; so you shall put away the evil from Israel. If a young woman who is a virgin is betrothed to a husband, and a man finds her in the city and lies with her, then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he humbled his neighbor's wife; so you shall put away the evil from among you. Tertullian wrote regarding love for enemies: Our individual, extraordinary, and perfect goodness consists in loving our enemies. To love one's friends is common practice, to love one's enemies only among Christians. Islam Al-Wadūd or The Loving is a name of God in Islam. In Islam, one of the names of God is Al-Wadūd, which means The Loving Love encompasses the Islamic view of life as universal brotherhood that applies to all who hold faith. Amongst the names of God Allah, there is the name Al-Wadud, or the Loving One, which is found in Surah Quran : as well as Surah Quran :. God is also referenced at the beginning of every chapter in the Qur'an as Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim, or the Most Compassionate and the Most Merciful, indicating that nobody is more loving, compassionate and benevolent than God. The Qur'an refers to God as being full of loving kindness. The Qur'an exhorts Muslim believers to treat all people, those who have not persecuted them, with birr or deep kindness as stated in Surah Quran : Birr is also used by the Qur'an in describing the love and kindness that children must show to their parents. Ishq, or divine love, is the emphasis of Sufism in the Islamic tradition. Practitioners of Sufism believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe. God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God looks at himself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices seeing the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is often referred to as the religion of love. God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms, which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved, with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through love, humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace. The saints of Sufism are infamous for being drunk due to their love of God; hence, the constant reference to wine in Sufi poetry and music. Bahá'í Faith In his Paris Talks, Abdu'l-Bahá described four types of love: the love that flows from God to human beings; the love that flows from human beings to God; the love of God towards the Self or Identity of God; and the love of human beings for human beings. Indian Buddhism In Buddhism, Kāma is sensuous, sexual love. It is an obstacle on the path to enlightenment, since it is selfish. Karuṇā is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom and is necessary for enlightenment. Adveṣa and mettā are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from ordinary love, which is usually about attachment and sex and which rarely occurs without self-interest. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare. The Bodhisattva ideal in Mahayana Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. Hinduism Main articles: Kama and Kama Sutra Kama left with Rati on a temple wall of Chennakesava Temple, Belur In Hinduism, kāma is pleasurable, sexual love, personified by the god Kamadeva. For many Hindu schools, it is the third end Kama in life. Kamadeva is often pictured holding a bow of sugar cane and an arrow of flowers; he may ride upon a great parrot. He is usually accompanied by his consort Rati and his companion Vasanta, lord of the spring season. Stone images of Kamadeva and Rati can be seen on the door of the Chennakeshava temple at Belur, in Karnataka, India. Maara is another name for kāma. In contrast to kāma, prema – or prem – refers to elevated love. Karuna is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. Bhakti is a Sanskrit term, meaning loving devotion to the supreme God. A person who practices bhakti is called a bhakta. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of bhakti, which can be found in the Bhagavata Purana and works by Tulsidas. The philosophical work Narada Bhakti Sutras, written by an unknown author presumed to be Narada, distinguishes eleven forms of love. In certain Vaishnava sects within Hinduism, attaining unadulterated, unconditional and incessant love for Godhead is considered the foremost goal of life. Gaudiya Vaishnavas who worship Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cause of all causes consider Love for Godhead Prema to act in two ways: sambhoga and vipralambha union and separation—two opposites. In the condition of separation, there is an acute yearning for being with the beloved and in the condition of union, there is supreme happiness and nectarean. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider that Krishna-prema Love for Godhead is not fire but that it still burns away one's material desires. They consider that Kṛṣṇa-prema is not a weapon, but it still pierces the heart. It is not water, but it washes away everything—one's pride, religious rules, and one's shyness. Krishna-prema is considered to make one drown in the ocean of transcendental ecstasy and pleasure. The love of Radha, a cowherd girl, for Krishna is often cited as the supreme example of love for Godhead by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Radha is considered to be the internal potency of Krishna, and is the supreme lover of Godhead. Her example of love is considered to be beyond the understanding of material realm as it surpasses any form of selfish love or lust that is visible in the material world. The reciprocal love between Radha the supreme lover and Krishna God as the Supremely Loved is the subject of many poetic compositions in India such as the Gita Govinda and Hari Bhakti Shuddhodhaya. In the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism, it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God taiche bhakti-phale krsne prema upajaya, and as love for God increases in the heart, the more one becomes free from material contamination krishna-prema asvada haile, bhava nasa paya. Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation. In this tradition, salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love, and just an incidental by-product. Being absorbed in Love for God is considered to be the perfection of life. Political views Free love Main article: Free love The term free love has been used to describe a social movement that rejects marriage, which is seen as a form of social bondage. The Free Love movement's initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, birth control, and adultery. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else. Many people in the early century believed that marriage was an important aspect of life to fulfill earthly human happiness. Middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. This mentality created a vision of strongly defined gender roles, which provoked the advancement of the free love movement as a contrast. The term sex radical has been used interchangeably with the term free lover. citation needed By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forceful sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases. These are also beliefs of Feminism. Philosophical views Main article: Philosophy of love The philosophy of love is a field of social philosophy and ethics that attempts to explain the nature of love. The philosophical investigation of love includes the tasks of distinguishing between the various kinds of personal love, asking if and how love is or can be justified, asking what the value of love is, and what impact love has on the autonomy of both the lover and the beloved. `

const fem = `Feminism is a range of socio-political movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. a Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male point of view, and that women are treated unjustly within those societies. Efforts to change that include fighting against gender stereotypes and establishing educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women that are equal to those for men. Feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women's rights, including the right to: vote, hold public office, work, earn equal pay, own property, receive education, enter contracts, have equal rights within marriage, and maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to contraception, legal abortions and social integration, and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in female dress standards and acceptable physical activities for females have often been part of feminist movements. Some scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender-neutral language, reproductive rights for women including access to contraceptives and abortion, and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims, because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles. Feminist theory, which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience; feminist theorists have developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender. Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Traditionally, since the century, first-wave liberal feminism that sought political and legal equality through reforms within a liberal democratic framework was contrasted with labour-based proletarian women's movements that over time developed into socialist and Marxist feminism based on class struggle theory. Since the, both of these traditions are also contrasted with radical feminism that arose from the radical wing of second-wave feminism and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate male supremacy; together liberal, socialist and radical feminism are sometimes called the Big Three schools of feminist thought. Since the late century, many newer forms of feminisms have emerged. Some forms of feminism have been criticized for taking into account only white, middle class, college-educated, heterosexual, or cisgender perspectives. These criticisms have led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism, such as black feminism and intersectional feminism. History Terminology Main article: History of feminism See also: Protofeminism Feminist suffrage parade, New York City, Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote about feminism for the Atlanta Constitution, December. After selling her home, Emmeline Pankhurst, pictured in New York City in, travelled constantly, giving speeches throughout Britain and the United States. In the Netherlands, Wilhelmina Drucker – fought successfully for the vote and equal rights for women, through organizations she founded. Simone Veil –, former French Minister of Health – made access to contraceptive pills easier and legalized abortion – – her greatest and hardest achievement. Louise Weiss along with other Parisian suffragettes in. The newspaper headline reads The Frenchwoman Must Vote. Mary Wollstonecraft is seen by many as a founder of feminism due to her book titled A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in which she argues for women's education. Charles Fourier, a utopian socialist and French philosopher, is credited with having coined the word féminisme in. The words féminisme feminism and féministe feminist first appeared in France and the Netherlands in, Great Britain in the, and the United States in. The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first appearance in English in this meaning back to. Depending on the historical moment, culture and country, feminists around the world have had different causes and goals. Most western feminist historians contend that all movements working to obtain women's rights should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not or do not apply the term to themselves. Other historians assert that the term should be limited to the modern feminist movement and its descendants. Those historians use the label protofeminist to describe earlier movements. Waves The history of the modern western feminist movement is divided into four waves. The first comprised women's suffrage movements of the th and early-th centuries, promoting women's right to vote. The second wave, the women's liberation movement, began in the s and campaigned for legal and social equality for women. In or around, a third wave was identified, characterized by a focus on individuality and diversity. Additionally, some have argued for the existence of a fourth wave, starting around, which has used social media to combat sexual harassment, violence against women and rape culture; it is best known for the Me Too movement. th and early-th centuries Main article: First-wave feminism First-wave feminism was a period of activity during the th and early-th centuries. In the UK and US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. New legislation included the Custody of Infants Act in the UK, which introduced the tender years doctrine for child custody and gave women the right of custody of their children for the first time. Other legislation, such as the Married Women's Property Act in the UK and extended in the Act, became models for similar legislation in other British territories. Victoria passed legislation in and New South Wales in ; the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between and. With the turn of the century, activism focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights too. Women's suffrage the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office began in Britain's Australasian colonies at the close of the century, with the self-governing colonies of New Zealand granting women the right to vote in ; South Australia followed suit with the Constitutional Amendment Adult Suffrage Act in. This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in. In Britain, the suffragettes and suffragists campaigned for the women's vote, and in the Representation of the People Act was passed granting the vote to women over the age of who owned property. In, this was extended to all women over. Emmeline Pankhurst was the most notable activist in England. Time named her one of the Most Important People of the th Century, stating: she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back. In the US, notable leaders of this movement included Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony, who each campaigned for the abolition of slavery before championing women's right to vote. These women were influenced by the Quaker theology of spiritual equality, which asserts that men and women are equal under God. In the US, first-wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, granting women the right to vote in all states. The term first wave was coined retroactively when the term second-wave feminism came into use. During the late Qing period and reform movements such as the Hundred Days' Reform, Chinese feminists called for women's liberation from traditional roles and Neo-Confucian gender segregation. Later, the Chinese Communist Party created projects aimed at integrating women into the workforce, and claimed that the revolution had successfully achieved women's liberation. According to Nawar al-Hassan Golley, Arab feminism was closely connected with Arab nationalism. In, Qasim Amin, considered the father of Arab feminism, wrote The Liberation of Women, which argued for legal and social reforms for women. He drew links between women's position in Egyptian society and nationalism, leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement. In Hoda Shaarawi founded the Egyptian Feminist Union, became its president and a symbol of the Arab women's rights movement. The Iranian Constitutional Revolution in triggered the Iranian women's movement, which aimed to achieve women's equality in education, marriage, careers, and legal rights. However, during the Iranian revolution of, many of the rights that women had gained from the women's movement were systematically abolished, such as the Family Protection Law. Mid-century By the mid-century, women still lacked significant rights. In France, women obtained the right to vote only with the Provisional Government of the French Republic of April. The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of proposed on March to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by Fernard Grenier, they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote. Grenier's proposition was adopted to. In May, following the November elections, the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the gender gap, stating in Le Populaire that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes. During the baby boom period, feminism waned in importance. Wars both World War I and World War II had seen the provisional emancipation of some women, but post-war periods signalled the return to conservative roles. In Switzerland, women gained the right to vote in federal elections in ;better source needed but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of. Three prior referendums held in, and had failed to secure women's right to vote. Photograph of American women replacing men fighting in Europe, Feminists continued to campaign for the reform of family laws which gave husbands control over their wives. Although by the century coverture had been abolished in the UK and US, in many continental European countries married women still had very few rights. For instance, in France, married women did not receive the right to work without their husband's permission until. Feminists have also worked to abolish the marital exemption in rape laws which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives. Earlier efforts by first-wave feminists such as Voltairine de Cleyre, Victoria Woodhull and Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy to criminalize marital rape in the late century had failed; this was only achieved a century later in most Western countries, but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world. French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir provided a Marxist solution and an existentialist view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of Le Deuxième Sexe The Second Sex in. The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice. Second-wave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination. Second-wave feminists see women's cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures. The feminist activist and author Carol Hanisch coined the slogan The Personal is Political, which became synonymous with the second wave. Second- and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of women's roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women's equality has actually been fully achieved. In, President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt initiated state feminism, which outlawed discrimination based on gender and granted women's suffrage, but also blocked political activism by feminist leaders. During Sadat's presidency, his wife, Jehan Sadat, publicly advocated further women's rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equality with the new Islamist movement and growing conservatism. However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, Islamic feminism, which argues for women's equality within an Islamic framework. In Latin America, revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as Nicaragua, where feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change. In, Betty Friedan's book The Feminine Mystique helped voice the discontent that American women felt. The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second-wave feminism in the United States. Within ten years, women made up over half the First World workforce. Late th and early st centuries Third-wave feminism Main article: Third-wave feminism Feminist, author and social activist bell hooks b. Third-wave feminism is traced to the emergence of the riot grrrl feminist punk subculture in Olympia, Washington, in the early, and to Anita Hill's televised testimony in —to an all-male, all-white Senate Judiciary Committee—that Clarence Thomas, nominated for the Supreme Court of the United States, had sexually harassed her. The term third wave is credited to Rebecca Walker, who responded to Thomas's appointment to the Supreme Court with an article in Ms. magazine, Becoming the Third Wave. She wrote: So I write this as a plea to all women, especially women of my generation: Let Thomas' confirmation serve to remind you, as it did me, that the fight is far from over. Let this dismissal of a woman's experience move you to anger. Turn that outrage into political power. Do not vote for them unless they work for us. Do not have sex with them, do not break bread with them, do not nurture them if they don't prioritize our freedom to control our bodies and our lives. I am not a post-feminism feminist. I am the Third Wave. Third-wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave's essentialist definitions of femininity, which, third-wave feminists argued, over-emphasized the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focused on micro-politics and challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what was, or was not, good for women, and tended to use a post-structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as Gloria Anzaldúa, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherríe Moraga, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities. Third-wave feminism also contained internal debates between difference feminists, who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to social conditioning. Standpoint theory Standpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view stating that a person's social position influences their knowledge. This perspective argues that research and theory treat women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased. Since the, standpoint feminists have argued that the feminist movement should address global issues such as rape, incest, and prostitution and culturally specific issues such as female genital mutilation in some parts of Africa and Arab societies, as well as glass ceiling practices that impede women's advancement in developed economies in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, homophobia, classism and colonization in a matrix of domination. Fourth-wave feminism Main article: Fourth-wave feminism Protest against La Manada sexual abuse case sentence, Pamplona, Fourth-wave feminism is a proposed extension of third-wave feminism which corresponds to a resurgence in interest in feminism beginning around and associated with the use of social media. According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to sexual harassment and violence against women. Its essence, she writes, is incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist. Fourth-wave feminism is defined by technology, according to Kira Cochrane, and is characterized particularly by the use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, and blogs such as Feministing to challenge misogyny and further gender equality. Women's March, Washington, D. C. Issues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include street and workplace harassment, campus sexual assault and rape culture. Scandals involving the harassment, abuse, and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement. These have included the Delhi gang rape, Jimmy Savile allegations, the Bill Cosby allegations, Isla Vista killings, trial of Jian Ghomeshi, Harvey Weinstein allegations and subsequent Weinstein effect, and the Westminster sexual scandals. International Women's Strike, Paraná, Argentina, Examples of fourth-wave feminist campaigns include the Everyday Sexism Project, No More Page, Stop Bild Sexism, Mattress Performance, Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman, #YesAllWomen, Free the Nipple, One Billion Rising, the Women's March, the Women's March, and the #MeToo movement. In December, Time magazine chose several prominent female activists involved in the #MeToo movement, dubbed the silence breakers, as Person of the Year. Postfeminism Main article: Postfeminism The term postfeminism is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the s. While not being anti-feminist, postfeminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third- and fourth-wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas. Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society. Amelia Jones has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the s and s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity. Dorothy Chunn describes a blaming narrative under the postfeminist moniker, where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for gender equality in a post-feminist society, where gender equality has already been achieved. According to Chunn, many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them. Theory Main article: Feminist theory See also: Gynocriticism and écriture féminine Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work in a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis, and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification especially sexual objectification, oppression, and patriarchy. In the field of literary criticism, Elaine Showalter describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls feminist critique, in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls gynocriticism, in which the woman is producer of textual meaning. The last phase she calls gender theory, in which the ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored. This was paralleled in the s by French feminists, who developed the concept of écriture féminine which translates as female or feminine writing. Hélène Cixous argues that writing and philosophy are phallocentric and along with other French feminists such as Luce Irigaray emphasize writing from the body as a subversive exercise. The work of Julia Kristeva, a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, and Bracha Ettinger, artist and psychoanalyst, has influenced feminist theory in general and feminist literary criticism in particular. However, as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out, none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the Anglophone world. More recent feminist theory, such as that of Lisa Lucile Owens, has concentrated on characterizing feminism as a universal emancipatory movement. Movements and ideologies Main article: Feminist movements and ideologies Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years. Feminism is often divided into three main traditions called liberal, radical and socialist/Marxist feminism, sometimes known as the Big Three schools of feminist thought. Since the late century, newer forms of feminisms have also emerged. Some branches of feminism track the political leanings of the larger society to a greater or lesser degree, or focus on specific topics, such as the environment. Liberal feminism Main article: Liberal feminism Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a major figure in th-century liberal feminism Liberal feminism, also known under other names such as reformist, mainstream, or historically as bourgeois feminism, arose from th-century first-wave feminism, and was historically linked to th-century liberalism and progressivism, while th-century conservatives tended to oppose feminism as such. Liberal feminism seeks equality of men and women through political and legal reform within a liberal democratic framework, without radically altering the structure of society; liberal feminism works within the structure of mainstream society to integrate women into that structure. During the th and early th centuries liberal feminism focused especially on women's suffrage and access to education. Former Norwegian supreme court justice and former president of the liberal Norwegian Association for Women's Rights, Karin Maria Bruzelius, has described liberal feminism as a realistic, sober, practical feminism. Eva Kolstad, a major figure in the development of postwar liberal state feminism in the Nordic countries Susan Wendell argues that liberal feminism is an historical tradition that grew out of liberalism, as can be seen very clearly in the work of such feminists as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill, but feminists who took principles from that tradition have developed analyses and goals that go far beyond those of th and century liberal feminists, and many feminists who have goals and strategies identified as liberal feminist,reject major components of liberalism in a modern or party-political sense; she highlights equality of opportunity as a defining feature of liberal feminism. Liberal feminism is a very broad term that encompasses many, often diverging modern branches and a variety of feminist and general political perspectives; some historically liberal branches are equality feminism, social feminism, equity feminism, difference feminism, individualist/libertarian feminism and some forms of state feminism, particularly the state feminism of the Nordic countries. The broad field of liberal feminism is sometimes confused with the more recent and smaller branch known as libertarian feminism, which tends to diverge significantly from mainstream liberal feminism. For example, libertarian feminism does not require social measures to reduce material inequality; in fact, it opposes such measures,in contrast, liberal feminism may support such requirements and egalitarian versions of feminism insist on them. Catherine Rottenberg notes that the raison d'être of classic liberal feminism was to pose an immanent critique of liberalism, revealing the gendered exclusions within liberal democracy's proclamation of universal equality, particularly with respect to the law, institutional access, and the full incorporation of women into the public sphere. Rottenberg contrasts classic liberal feminism with modern neoliberal feminism which seems perfectly in sync with the evolving neoliberal order. According to Zhang and Rios, liberal feminism tends to be adopted by 'mainstream' i. e., middle-class women who do not disagree with the current social structure. They found that liberal feminism with its focus on equality is viewed as the dominant and default form of feminism. Some modern forms of feminism that historically grew out of the broader liberal tradition have more recently also been described as conservative in relative terms. This is particularly the case for libertarian feminism which conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference. Radical feminism The merged Venus symbol with raised fist is a common symbol of radical feminism, one of the movements within feminism Radical feminism arose from the radical wing of second-wave feminism and calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate male supremacy. It considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary. Separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist. Materialist ideologies Emma Goldman a union activist, labour organizer and feminist anarchist Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of different but overlapping movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. Anarcha-feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy. Other modern feminisms Ecofeminism Ecofeminists see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment. Ecofeminism has been criticized for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature. Black and postcolonial ideologies Further information: Intersectional feminism Sara Ahmed argues that Black and postcolonial feminisms pose a challenge to some of the organizing premises of Western feminist thought. During much of its history, feminist movements and theoretical developments were led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America. However, women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms. This trend accelerated in the s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the end of Western European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in developing nations and former colonies and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms. Womanism emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle-class. Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless. Third-world feminism and indigenous feminism are closely related to postcolonial feminism. These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism, motherism, Stiwanism, negofeminism, femalism, transnational feminism, and Africana womanism. Social constructionist ideologies Main article: Social construction of gender In the late century various feminists began to argue that gender roles are socially constructed, and that it is impossible to generalize women's experiences across cultures and histories. Post-structural feminism draws on the philosophies of post-structuralism and deconstruction in order to argue that the concept of gender is created socially and culturally through discourse. Postmodern feminists also emphasize the social construction of gender and the discursive nature of reality; however, as Pamela Abbott et al. write, a postmodern approach to feminism highlights the existence of multiple truths rather than simply men and women's standpoints. Transgender people Main article: Feminist views on transgender topics Third-wave feminists tend to view the struggle for trans rights as an integral part of intersectional feminism. Fourth-wave feminists also tend to be trans-inclusive. The American National Organization for Women NOW president Terry O'Neill said the struggle against transphobia is a feminist issue and NOW has affirmed that trans women are women, trans girls are girls. Several studies have found that people who identify as feminists tend to be more accepting of trans people than those who do not. An ideology variously known as trans-exclusionary radical feminism or its acronym, TERF or gender-critical feminism is critical of the concept of gender identity, transgender rights, holds that biological sex is immutable, and that trans women are not women. These views have been described as transphobic by other feminists. Cultural movements Riot grrrls took an anti-corporate stance of self-sufficiency and self-reliance. Riot grrrl's emphasis on universal female identity and separatism often appears more closely allied with second-wave feminism than with the third wave. The movement encouraged and made adolescent girls' standpoints central, allowing them to express themselves fully. Lipstick feminism is a cultural feminist movement that attempts to respond to the backlash of second-wave radical feminism of the s and s by reclaiming symbols of feminine identity such as make-up, suggestive clothing and having a sexual allure as valid and empowering personal choices. Demographics According to Ipsos poll covering developed countries, percent of respondents identified as feminists, and agreed that women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency, not their gender. However, only of women agreed that they have full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations. Taken together, these studies reflect the importance differentiating between claiming a feminist identity and holding feminist attitudes or beliefs United States According to a poll, percent of Americans use the label of feminist to describe themselves, while percent are feminists in practice as they reported they believe in equality for women. Despite the popular belief in what feminism stands for, percent did not identify as feminist, percent were unsure, and four percent provided no response. Sociological research shows that, in the US, increased educational attainment is associated with greater support for feminist issues. In addition, politically liberal people are more likely to support feminist ideals compared to those who are conservative. United Kingdom According to numerous polls, of Britons use the label of 'feminist' to describe themselves, with being feminist in practice by saying they support equality of opportunity for women – this included even higher support from men than women. Sexuality Main article: Feminist views on sexuality Feminist views on sexuality vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late s and the, in what came to be known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the s and s. Over the course of the, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism. Sex industry Main articles: Sex industry, Feminist views on pornography, Feminist views on prostitution, Feminist sex wars, and Male prostitution § Feminist studies Opinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists who are critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality. For the views of feminism on male prostitutes see the article on male prostitution. Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression. Similarly, feminists' views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive. Affirming female sexual autonomy See also: My body, my choice For feminists, a woman's right to control her own sexuality is a key issue. Feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances. Feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that largely deny women the right to decide how to express their sexuality, because men under patriarchy feel entitled to define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In some conservative and religious cultures marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour. In more liberal cultures, this entitlement takes the form of a general sexualization of the whole culture. This is played out in the sexual objectification of women, with pornography and other forms of sexual entertainment creating the fantasy that all women exist solely for men's sexual pleasure and that women are readily available and desiring to engage in sex at any time, with any man, on a man's terms. In, feminist Anne Koedt argued in her essay The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm that women's biology and the clitoral orgasm had not been properly analyzed and popularized, because men have orgasms essentially by friction with the vagina and not the clitoral area. Science Further information: Feminist epistemology Sandra Harding says that the moral and political insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds. Some feminists, such as Ruth Hubbard and Evelyn Fox Keller, criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective. A part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions. Physicist Lisa Randall, appointed to a task force at Harvard by then-president Lawrence Summers after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, I just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don't have to come up anymore. Lynn Hankinson Nelson writes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women and to uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them to account for a range of human experience. Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions. Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality. One criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings. Susan Haack also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women's thinking as intuitive and emotional, etc.; Meera Nanda further cautions that this may in fact trap women within traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy. Biology and gender Further information: Gender essentialism and Sexual differentiation Modern feminism challenges the essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes scientific evidence that suggests that there is an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences. Feminist psychology Main article: Feminist psychology Feminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates in psychology, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline. Culture Main article: Feminism in culture Design There is a long history of feminist activity in design disciplines like industrial design, graphic design and fashion design. This work has explored topics like beauty, DIY, feminine approaches to design and community-based projects. Some iconic writing includes Cheryl Buckley's essays on design and patriarchy and Joan Rothschild's Design and Feminism: Re-Visioning Spaces, Places, and Everyday Things. More recently, Isabel Prochner's research explored how feminist perspectives can support positive change in industrial design, helping to identify systemic social problems and inequities in design and guiding socially sustainable and grassroots design solutions. Businesses See also: Feminist businesses Feminist activists have established a range of feminist businesses, including feminist bookstores, credit unions, presses, mail-order catalogs and restaurants. These businesses flourished as part of the second and third waves of feminism in the, and s. Visual arts Main article: Feminist art movement Corresponding with general developments within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the s and flourished throughout the s. Jeremy Strick, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, described the feminist art movement as the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period, and Peggy Phelan says that it brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing over the past four decades. Feminist artist Judy Chicago, who created The Dinner Party, a set of vulva-themed ceramic plates in the, said in to ARTnews, There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male Eurocentric narrative. We are trying to change the future: to get girls and boys to realize that women's art is not an exception—it's a normal part of art history. A feminist approach to the visual arts has most recently developed through cyberfeminism and the posthuman turn, giving voice to the ways contemporary female artists are dealing with gender, social media and the notion of embodiment. Literature Octavia Butler, award-winning feminist science fiction author Main article: Feminist literature See also: Écriture féminine, List of American feminist literature, List of feminist literature, and List of feminist poets The feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in women's writing. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's historical and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest. There has also been a close link between feminist literature and activism, with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era. Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like Dale Spender's Mothers of the Novel and Jane Spencer's The Rise of the Woman Novelist were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing. Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. Virago Press began to publish its large list of th- and early-th-century novels in and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of th-century novels written by women. More recently, Broadview Press continues to issue th- and th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the University of Kentucky has a series of republications of early women's novels. Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft, is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. A Room of One's Own by Virginia Woolf, is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy. The widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the literary canon. Interest in post-colonial literatures, gay and lesbian literature, writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered literature, and genres hitherto not regarded as literary, such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest. Most genres and subgenres have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies have entered new territories such as the female gothic or women's science fiction. According to Elyce Rae Helford, Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice. Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender. Notable texts of this kind are Ursula K. Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness, Joanna Russ' The Female Man, Octavia Butler's Kindred and Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale. Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States. In addition, many feminist movements have embraced poetry as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings. Moreover, historical pieces of writing by women have been used by feminists to speak about what women's lives would have been like in the past, while demonstrating the power that they held and the impact they had in their communities even centuries ago. An important figure in the history of women in relation to literature is Hrotsvitha. Hrotsvitha was a canoness from, as the first female poetess in the German lands, and first female historian Hrotsvitha is one of the few people to speak about women's lives from a woman's perspective during the Middle Ages. Music Main articles: Women's music and Women in music American jazz singer and songwriter Billie Holiday in New York City in Women's music or womyn's music or wimmin's music is the music by women, for women, and about women. The genre emerged as a musical expression of the second-wave feminist movement as well as the labour, civil rights, and peace movements. The movement was started by lesbians such as Cris Williamson, Meg Christian, and Margie Adam, African-American women activists such as Bernice Johnson Reagon and her group Sweet Honey in the Rock, and peace activist Holly Near. Women's music also refers to the wider industry of women's music that goes beyond the performing artists to include studio musicians, producers, sound engineers, technicians, cover artists, distributors, promoters, and festival organizers who are also women. Riot grrrl is an underground feminist hardcore punk movement described in the cultural movements section of this article. Feminism became a principal concern of musicologists in the s as part of the New Musicology. Prior to this, in the, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of canon, genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked. Through the s and, this trend continued as musicologists like Susan McClary, Marcia Citron and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time. While the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the leader of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process. Cinema Main article: Feminist film theory See also: Women's cinema Feminist cinema, advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives, arose largely with the development of feminist film theory in the late s and early s. Women who were radicalized during the s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women. Differences were particularly marked between feminists on either side of the Atlantic. saw the first feminist film festivals in the U. S. and U. K. as well as the first feminist film journal, Women and Film. Trailblazers from this period included Claire Johnston and Laura Mulvey, who also organized the Women's Event at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include Teresa de Lauretis, Anneke Smelik and Kaja Silverman. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution. It has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent, theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking. 'Deconstruction' concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema, aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema. The second approach, a feminist counterculture, embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language. Bracha L. Ettinger invented a field of notions and concepts that serve the research of cinema from feminine perspective: The Matrixial Gaze. Ettinger's language include original concepts to discover feminine perspectives. Many writers in the fields of film theory and contemporary art are using the Ettingerian matrixial sphere matricial sphere. During the s–s heyday of the big Hollywood studios, the status of women in the industry was abysmal. Since then female directors such as Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion have made art movies, and directors like Kathryn Bigelow and Patty Jenkins have had mainstream success. This progress stagnated in the, and men outnumber women five to one in behind the camera roles. Politics British-born suffragist Rose Cohen was executed in Stalin's Great Terror in, two months after the execution of her Soviet husband. Feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the century. Socialism Main article: Social Progressivism and Counterculture Since the late century, some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women's rights. August Bebel, an early activist of the German Social Democratic Party SPD, published his work Die Frau und der Sozialismus, juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In there was an International Conference of Socialist Women in Stuttgart where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. Clara Zetkin of the SPD called for women's suffrage to build a socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question. In Britain, the women's movement was allied with the Labour party. In the U. S., Betty Friedan emerged from a radical background to take leadership. Radical Women is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U. S. and is still active. During the Spanish Civil War, Dolores Ibárruri La Pasionaria led the Communist Party of Spain. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women fighting on the front and clashed with the anarcha-feminist Mujeres Libres. Feminists in Ireland in the early century included the revolutionary Irish Republican, suffragette and socialist Constance Markievicz who in was the first woman elected to the British House of Commons. However, in line with Sinn Féin abstentionist policy, she would not take her seat in the House of Commons. She was re-elected to the Second Dáil in the elections of. She was also a commander of the Irish Citizens Army, which was led by the socialist and self-described feminist Irish leader James Connolly, during the Easter Rising. Fascism Further information: Fascism and ideology and Women in Nazi Germany Chilean feminists protest against the regime of Augusto Pinochet. Fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the Fascist manifesto in was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age and above, including women accomplished only in, after the defeat of fascism and eligibility for all to stand for office from age. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary groups such as the fasci femminilli and only partly realized in, under pressure from dictator Benito Mussolini's more conservative coalition partners. Cyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of Adolf Hitler, feminism has a complicated relationship with the Nazi movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment. However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism, and after the rise of Nazism in Germany in, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period and to some extent during the s. Georges Duby et al. write that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position. Blamires also writes that neofascism has since the s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept their traditional roles. Civil rights movement and anti-racism The civil rights movement has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many American feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tensions arose during the late s and the s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white, straight, and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with issues of race and sexuality. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist and homophobic elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about identity politics and the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism; they also generated new feminisms such as black feminism and Chicana feminism in addition to making large contributions to lesbian feminism and other integrations of queer of colour identity. Neoliberalism Neoliberalism has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe, especially in the global south. Masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking.:   Women's experiences in non-industrialized countries reveal often deleterious effects of modernization policies and undercut orthodox claims that development benefits everyone.:   Proponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing women's participation in the workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have stated that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations.: –  Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women's subordination in the family and the workplace.:   The feminization of employment refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe and secure.:   Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages.:   Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part in this, for instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as 'secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.:   Societal impact Main article: Feminist effects on society The feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; greater access to education; more equal payment to men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy including access to contraceptives and abortion; and the right to own property. Civil rights Participation in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Signed and ratified Acceded or succeeded Unrecognized state, abiding by treaty Only signed Non-signatory From the s on, the campaign for women's rights was met with mixed results in the U. S. and the U. K. Other countries of the EEC agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community. Some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to child sexual abuse. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men's responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults. In the U. S., the National Organization for Women NOW began in to seek women's equality, including through the Equal Rights Amendment ERA, which did not pass, although some states enacted their own. Reproductive rights in the U. S. centred on the court decision in Roe v. Wade enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable birth control, allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the s in the U. S. under Margaret Sanger and elsewhere under Marie Stopes. In the final three decades of the century, Western women knew a new freedom through birth control, which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family. better source needed The division of labour within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the century. Sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework, although Cathy Young responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting. Judith K. Brown writes, Women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics: the participant is not obliged to be far from home; the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration and the work is not dangerous, can be performed in spite of interruptions, and is easily resumed once interrupted. In international law, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women CEDAW is an international convention adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and described as an international bill of rights for women. It came into force in those nations ratifying it. Jurisprudence Main article: Feminist legal theory Feminist jurisprudence is a branch of jurisprudence that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights. Feminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see the law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience. Language Further information: Gender-neutral language in English Proponents of gender-neutral language argue that the use of gender-specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society. According to The Handbook of English Linguistics, generic masculine pronouns and gender-specific job titles are instances where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species. Merriam-Webster chose feminism as its Word of the Year, noting that Word of the Year is a quantitative measure of interest in a particular word. Theology See also: Feminist theology, Gender of God, and Goddess movement Cmdr. Adrienne Simmons speaking at the ceremony for the only women's mosque in Khost City, a symbol of progress for growing women's rights in the Pashtun belt Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts. Christian feminism is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. Islamic feminists advocate women's rights, gender equality, and social justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, hadith sayings of Muhammad, and sharia law towards the creation of a more equal and just society. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement. Buddhist feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Buddhism. It is an aspect of feminist theology which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective. The Buddhist feminist Rita Gross describes Buddhist feminism as the radical practice of the co-humanity of women and men. Jewish feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or minyan, the exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot, and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce. Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history. Dianic Wicca is a feminist-centred thealogy. Secular or atheist feminists have engaged in feminist criticism of religion, arguing that many religions have oppressive rules towards women and misogynistic themes and elements in religious texts. Patriarchy Main article: Patriarchy Female Muslims- The tsar, beys and khans took your rights away – Soviet poster issued in Azerbaijan, Patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system, fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege and is dependent on female subordination. Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women. Carole Pateman argues that the patriarchal distinction between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection. In feminist theory the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations. Some radical feminists have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society, separatism is the only viable solution. Other feminists have criticized these views as being anti-men. Men and masculinity Main article: Men and feminism Feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality. The social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition, and reinforces patriarchal and unequal gender relations. Patriarchal cultures are criticized for limiting forms of masculinity available to men and thus narrowing their life choices. Some feminists are engaged with men's issues activism, such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men. Male participation in feminism is generally encouraged by feminists and is seen as an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that men and women should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency. Reactions Different groups of people have responded to feminism, and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics. Among American university students, for both men and women, support for feminist ideas is more common than self-identification as a feminist. The US media tends to portray feminism negatively and feminists are less often associated with day-to-day work/leisure activities of regular women. However, as recent research has demonstrated, as people are exposed to self-identified feminists and to discussions relating to various forms of feminism, their own self-identification with feminism increases. Pro-feminism Main article: Pro-feminism Pro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres. Anti-feminism and criticism of feminism Main article: Antifeminism Anti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms. In the century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality. Some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. Anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained. Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families. Writers such as Camille Paglia, Christina Hoff Sommers, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, Lisa Lucile Owens and Daphne Patai oppose some forms of feminism, though they identify as feminists. They argue, for example, that feminism often promotes misandry and the elevation of women's interests above men's, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women. Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge argue that the term anti-feminist is used to silence academic debate about feminism. Lisa Lucile Owens argues that certain rights extended exclusively to women are patriarchal because they relieve women from exercising a crucial aspect of their moral agency. Secular humanism Secular humanism is an ethical framework that attempts to dispense with any unreasoned dogma, pseudoscience, and superstition. Critics of feminism sometimes ask Why feminism and not humanism?. Some humanists argue, however, that the goals of feminists and humanists largely overlap, and the distinction is only in motivation. For example, a humanist may consider abortion in terms of a utilitarian ethical framework, rather than considering the motivation of any particular woman in getting an abortion. In this respect, it is possible to be a humanist without being a feminist, but this does not preclude the existence of feminist humanism. Humanism played a significant role in protofeminism during the Renaissance period in such that humanists made educated women popular figures despite the challenge of the patriarchal organization of society. `
const dys = `A Dystopia from Ancient Greek δυσ- bad, hard and τόπος place; alternatively cacotopia or simply anti-utopia is a speculated community or society that is undesirable or frightening. It is often treated as an antonym of utopia, a term that was coined by Sir Thomas More and figures as the title of his best known work, published in, which created a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence and poverty. The relationship between utopia and dystopia is in actuality not one simple opposition, as many utopian elements and components are found in dystopias as well, and vice versa. Dystopias are often characterized by rampant fear or distress, tyrannical governments, environmental disaster, or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Distinct themes typical of a Dystopian Society include: complete control over the people in a society through the usage of propaganda, heavy censoring of information or denial of free thought, worshiping an unattainable goal, the complete loss of individuality, and heavy enforcement of conformity. Despite certain overlaps, dystopian fiction is distinct from post-apocalyptic fiction, and an undesirable society is not necessarily dystopian. Dystopian societies appear in many fictional works and artistic representations, particularly in stories set in the future. The best known by far is George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Other famous examples are Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit. Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to society, environment, politics, economics, religion, psychology, ethics, science, or technology. Some authors use the term to refer to existing societies, many of which are, or have been, totalitarian states or societies in an advanced state of collapse. Dystopias, through an exaggerated worst-case scenario, often make a criticism about a current trend, societal norm, or political system. The entire substantial sub-genre of alternative history works depicting a world in which Nazi Germany won the Second World War can be considered as dystopias. So can other works of Alternative History, in which a historical turning point led to a manifestly repressive world. For example, the mockumentary C. S. A.: The Confederate States of America, and Ben Winters' Underground Airlines, in which slavery in the United States continues to the present, with electronic slave auctions carried out via the Internet and slaves controlled by electronic devices implanted in their spines, or Keith Roberts Pavane in which th Century Britain is ruled by a Catholic theocracy and the Inquisition is actively torturing and burning heretics. citation needed Some scholars, such as Gregory Claeys and Lyman Tower Sargent, make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias. For example, Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the society in which the author writes. Some of these are anti-utopias, which criticise attempts to implement various concepts of utopia. In the most comprehensive treatment of the literary and real expressions of the concept, Dystopia: A Natural History, Claeys offers a historical approach to these definitions. Here the tradition is traced from early reactions to the French Revolution. Its commonly anti-collectivist character is stressed, and the addition of other themes—the dangers of science and technology, of social inequality, of corporate dictatorship, of nuclear war—are also traced. A psychological approach is also favored here, with the principle of fear being identified with despotic forms of rule, carried forward from the history of political thought, and group psychology introduced as a means of understanding the relationship between utopia and dystopia. Andrew Norton-Schwartzbard noted that written many centuries before the concept dystopia existed, Dante's Inferno in fact includes most of the typical characteristics associated with this genre – even if placed in a religious framework rather than in the future of the mundane world, as modern dystopias tend to be. In the same vein, Vicente Angeloti remarked that George Orwell's emblematic phrase, a boot stamping on a human face — forever, would aptly describe the situation of the denizens in Dante's Hell. Conversely, Dante's famous inscription Abandon all hope, ye who enter here would have been equally appropriate if placed at the entrance to Orwell's Ministry of Love and its notorious Room. Etymology Dustopia being the original spelling for Dystopia first appeared in Lewis Henry Younges, Utopia: or Apollos Golden Days in. Additionally, dystopia was used as an antonym for utopia by John Stuart Mill in one of his Parliamentary Speeches Hansard Commons by adding the prefix dys Ancient Greek: δυσ- bad to topia, reinterpreting the initial u as the prefix eu Ancient Greek: ευ- good instead of ou Ancient Greek: οὐ not. It was used to denounce the government's Irish land policy: It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or caco-topians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable. Decades before the first documented use of the word dystopia was cacotopia/kakotopia using Ancient Greek: κακόs, bad, wicked originally proposed in by Jeremy Bentham, As a match for utopia or the imagined seat of the best government suppose a cacotopia or the imagined seat of the worst government discovered and described. Though dystopia became the more popular term, cacotopia finds occasional use; Anthony Burgess, author of A Clockwork Orange, said it was a better fit for Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four because it sounds worse than dystopia. Society See also: Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction § In society People Leaving the Cities, photo art by Zbigniew Libera, imagines a dystopian future in which people have to leave dying metropolises Dystopias typically reflect contemporary sociopolitical realities and extrapolate worst-case scenarios as warnings for necessary social change or caution. Dystopian fictions invariably reflect the concerns and fears of their creators' contemporaneous culture. Due to this, they can be considered a subject of social studies. citation needed In dystopias, citizens may live in a dehumanized state, be under constant surveillance, or have a fear of the outside world. In the film What Happened to Monday the protagonists risk their lives by taking turns onto the outside world because of a one-child policy place in this futuristic dystopian society. citation needed In a study, Frank Kermode suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Christopher Schmidt notes that, while the world goes to waste for future generations, people distract themselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment. In the, there was a surge of popular dystopian young adult literature and blockbuster films. Some have commented on this trend, saying that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism. Cultural theorist and critic Mark Fisher identified the phrase as encompassing the theory of capitalist realism ‐ the perceived widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it – and used the above quote as the title to the opening chapter of his book, Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?. In the book, he also refers to dystopian film such as Children of Men originally a novel by P. D. James to illustrate what he describes as the slow cancellation of the future. Theo James, an actor in Divergent originally a novel by Veronica Roth, explains that young people in particular have such a fascination with this kind of story,It's becoming part of the consciousness. You grow up in a world where it's part of the conversation all the time – the statistics of our planet warming up. The environment is changing. The weather is different. There are things that are very visceral and very obvious, and they make you question the future and how we will survive. It's so much a part of everyday life that young people inevitably – consciously or not – are questioning their futures and how the Earth will be. I certainly do. I wonder what kind of world my children's kids will live in. Common themes Politics In When the Sleeper Wakes, H. G. Wells depicted the governing class as hedonistic and shallow. George Orwell contrasted Wells's world to that depicted in Jack London's The Iron Heel, where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism, which Orwell considered more plausible. The political principles at the root of fictional utopias or perfect worlds are idealistic in principle and result in positive consequences for the inhabitants; the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based, while often based on utopian ideals, result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one fatal flaw. Dystopias are often filled with pessimistic views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring, ruling with an iron fist. citation needed Dystopian governments are sometimes ruled by a fascist or communist regime or dictator. These dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a resistance to enact change within their society, as is seen in Alan Moore'sfor Vendetta. Dystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as We, Parable of the Sower, Darkness at Noon, Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, The Handmaid's Tale, The Hunger Games, Divergent and Fahrenheit and such films as Metropolis, Brazil, Battle Royale, FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions, Soylent Green, Logan's Run, and The Running Man. citation needed Economics The economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations, as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression. There are several archetypes that such societies tend to follow. A theme is the dichotomy of planned economies versus free market economies, a conflict which is found in such works as Ayn Rand's Anthem and Henry Kuttner's short story The Iron Standard. Another example of this is reflected in Norman Jewison's film Rollerball. citation needed Some dystopias, such as that of Nineteen Eighty-Four, feature black markets with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain or the characters may be at the mercy of the state-controlled economy. Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor; virtually all work is menial, unsatisfying and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work. In Tanith Lee's Don't Bite the Sun, there is no want of any kind – only unabashed consumption and hedonism, leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence. Even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society's flaws, as in Brave New World, the state often controls the economy; a character, reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body, cites as a reason that everyone works for everyone else. Other works feature extensive privatization and corporatism; both consequences of capitalism, where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions. They manipulate, infiltrate, control, bribe, are contracted by and function as government. This is seen in the novels Jennifer Government and Oryx and Crake and the movies Alien, Avatar, RoboCop, Visioneers, Idiocracy, Soylent Green, THX, WALL-E and Rollerball. Corporate republics are common in the cyberpunk genre, as in Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash and Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? as well as the film Blade Runner, influenced by and based upon Dick's novel. citation needed Class Dystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working class. citation needed In the novel Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, a class system is prenatally determined with Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons, with the lower classes having reduced brain-function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life. Outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that exist in the conventional way but which the class system describe as savages. citation needed In Ypsilon Minus by Herbert W. Franke, people are divided into numerous alphabetically ranked groups. citation needed In the film Elysium, the majority of Earth's population on the surface lives in poverty with little access to health care and are subject to worker exploitation and police brutality, while the wealthy live above the Earth in luxury with access to technologies that cure all diseases, reverse aging, and regenerate body parts. citation needed Written a century earlier, the future society depicted in H. G. Wells' The Time Machine had started in a similar way to Elysium – the workers consigned to living and working in underground tunnels while the wealthy live on a surface made into an enormous beautiful garden. But over a long time period the roles were eventually reversed – the rich degenerated and became a decadent livestock regularly caught and eaten by the underground cannibal Morlocks. citation needed Family Some fictional dystopias, such as Brave New World and Fahrenheit, have eradicated the family and keep it from re-establishing itself as a social institution. In Brave New World, where children are reproduced artificially, the concepts of mother and father are considered obscene. In some novels, such as We, the state is hostile to motherhood, as a pregnant woman from One State is in revolt. Religion Religious groups play the role of the oppressed and oppressors. In Brave New World the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses as symbols of Christianity to make them Ts, as symbols of Henry Ford's Model T. Margaret Atwood's novel The Handmaid's Tale takes place in a future United States under a Christian-based theocratic regime. One of the earliest examples of this theme is Robert Hugh Benson's Lord of the World, about a futuristic world where Marxists and Freemasons left by the Antichrist have taken over the world and the only remaining source of dissent is a tiny and persecuted Catholic minority. Identity In the Russian novel We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, first published in, people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names. The latter feature also appears in the later, unrelated film THX. In some dystopian works, such as Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron, society forces individuals to conform to radical egalitarian social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality. citation needed Violence Violence is prevalent in many dystopias, often in the form of war, but also in urban crimes led by predominately teenage gangs e. g. A Clockwork Orange, or rampant crime met by blood sports e. g. Battle Royale, The Running Man, The Hunger Games, Divergent, and The Purge. It is also explained in Suzanne Berne's essay Ground Zero, where she explains her experience of the aftermath of September. Nature Fictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world. Sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature, as when walks are regarded as dangerously anti-social in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit, as well as within Bradbury's short story The Pedestrian. citation needed In C. S. Lewis's That Hideous Strength, science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts. In Brave New World, the lower class is conditioned to be afraid of nature but also to visit the countryside and consume transport and games to promote economic activity. Lois Lowry's The Giver shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment, as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against human instincts. E. M. Forster's The Machine Stops depicts a highly changed global environment which forces people to live underground due to an atmospheric contamination. As Angel Galdon-Rodriguez points out, this sort of isolation caused by external toxic hazard is later used by Hugh Howey in his series of dystopias of the Silo Series. Excessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films, such as The Matrix, RoboCop, WALL-E, April and the Extraordinary World and Soylent Green, as well as in videogames like Half-Life. A few green fictional dystopias do exist, such as in Michael Carson's short story The Punishment of Luxury, and Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker. The latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war, a post-nuclear holocaust Kent, where technology has reduced to the level of the Iron Age. citation needed Science and technology Contrary to the technologically utopian claims, which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity, technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely but not always on the negative effects caused by new technology. Typical dystopian claims. Technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature. Jaron Lanier, a digital pioneer, has become a technological dystopian: I think its a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility. citation needed 'Oh, its the computer that did it, not me. 'Theres no more middle class? Oh, its not me. The computer did it' Lanier. This quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence. It also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification Technologies harm our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities. decrease in communication within family members and friend groups due to increased time in technology use virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence; people resort to technological medium for communication nowadays. Technologies reinforce hierarchies – concentrate knowledge and skills; increase surveillance and erode privacy; widen inequalities of power and wealth; giving up control to machines. Douglas Rushkoff, a technological utopian, states in his article that the professional designers re-mystified the computer so it wasn't so readable anymore; users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users New technologies are sometimes regressive worse than previous technologies The unforeseen impacts of technology are negative. 'The most common way is that theres some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate, and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free. But theres another way to look at it, which is the technically true way: You gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases… Its huge but very much like Facebook, its selling people back to themselves… With translation youre producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime, the original translators arent paid for their work… Youre actually shrinking the economy.. More efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life by causing stress, destroying jobs, making us more materialistic. In his article Prest-o! Change-o! technological dystopian James Gleick mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem it is meant to solve. Gleick quotes Edward Tenner, a historian of technology, that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer. Then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching New technologies can solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems. The remote control example explains this claim as well, for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control. He also takes social psychologist Robert Levine's example of Indonesians 'whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances, month after month, year after year, and with Nepalese Sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives. The Indonesians and Sherpas are perfectly satisfied. Because of the invention of the remote control, it merely created more problems Technologies destroy nature harming human health and the environment. The need for business replaced community and the story online replaced people as the soul of the Net. Because information was now able to be bought and sold, there was not as much communication taking place  `
const scifi = `cience fiction sometimes shortened to sci-fi or SF is a genre of speculative fiction which typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. It has been called the literature of ideas, and it often explores the potential consequences of scientific, social, and technological innovations. Science fiction can trace its roots back to ancient mythology, and is related to fantasy, horror, and superhero fiction, and contains many subgenres. Its exact definition has long been disputed among authors, critics, scholars, and readers. Science fiction, in literature, film, television, and other media, has become popular and influential over much of the world, and it is also often said to inspire a sense of wonder. Besides providing entertainment, it can also criticize present-day society and explore alternatives. Definitions Main article: Definitions of science fiction American science fiction author and editor Lester del Rey wrote, Even the devoted aficionado or fan—has a hard time trying to explain what science fiction is, and the lack of a full satisfactory definition is because there are no easily delineated limits to science fiction. According to Isaac Asimov, Science fiction can be defined as that branch of literature which deals with the reaction of human beings to changes in science and technology. Robert A. Heinlein wrote that A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method. Part of the reason that it is so difficult to pin down an agreed definition of science fiction is because there is a tendency among science fiction enthusiasts to act as their own arbiter in deciding what exactly constitutes science fiction. Damon Knight summed up the difficulty, saying science fiction is what we point to when we say it. Ultimately, it may be more useful to talk around science fiction as the intersection of other, more concrete, genres and subgenres. Alternative terms Further information: Skiffy Forrest J Ackerman has been credited with first using the term sci-fi analogous to the then-trendy hi-fi in about ; the first known use in print was a description of Donovan's Brain by movie critic Jesse Zunser in January. As science fiction entered popular culture, writers and fans active in the field came to associate the term with low-budget, low-tech B-movies, and with low-quality pulp science fiction. By the, critics within the field, such as Damon Knight and Terry Carr, were using sci fi to distinguish hack-work from serious science fiction. Peter Nicholls writes that SF or sf is the preferred abbreviation within the community of sf writers and readers. Robert Heinlein found even science fiction insufficient for certain types of works in this genre, and suggested the term speculative fiction to be used instead for those that are more serious or thoughtful. History Main articles: History of science fiction and Timeline of science fiction Illustration by Aubrey Beardsley for Lucian's A True Story Some scholars assert that science fiction had its beginnings in ancient times, when the line between myth and fact was blurred. Written in the nd century CE by the satirist Lucian, A True Story contains many themes and tropes characteristic of modern science fiction, including travel to other worlds, extraterrestrial lifeforms, interplanetary warfare, and artificial life. Some consider it the first science-fiction novel. Some of the stories from The Arabian Nights, along with the th-century The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter and Ibn al-Nafis's th-century Theologus Autodidactus, also contain elements of science fiction. Written during the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment, Johannes Kepler's Somnium, Francis Bacon's New Atlantis, Athanasius Kircher's Itinerarium extaticum, Cyrano de Bergerac's Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon and The States and Empires of the Sun, Margaret Cavendish's The Blazing World, Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Ludvig Holberg's Nicolai Klimii Iter Subterraneum and Voltaire's Micromégas are regarded as some of the first true science-fantasy works. Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan considered Somnium the first science-fiction story; it depicts a journey to the Moon and how the Earth's motion is seen from there. Following the th-century development of the novel as a literary form, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and The Last Man helped define the form of the science-fiction novel. Brian Aldiss has argued that Frankenstein was the first work of science fiction. Edgar Allan Poe wrote several stories considered to be science fiction, including The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall which featured a trip to the Moon. Jules Verne was noted for his attention to detail and scientific accuracy, especially in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. In, the novel El anacronópete by Spanish author Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau introduced the first time machine. H. G. Wells Many critics consider H. G. Wells one of science fiction's most important authors, or even the Shakespeare of science fiction. His notable science-fiction works include The Time Machine, The Island of Doctor Moreau, The Invisible Man, and The War of the Worlds. His science fiction imagined alien invasion, biological engineering, invisibility, and time travel. In his non-fiction futurologist works he predicted the advent of airplanes, military tanks, nuclear weapons, satellite television, space travel, and something resembling the World Wide Web. Edgar Rice Burroughs' A Princess of Mars, published in, was the first of his three-decade-long planetary romance series of Barsoom novels which were set on Mars and featured John Carter as the hero. In, Hugo Gernsback published the first American science-fiction magazine, Amazing Stories. In its first issue he wrote: By 'scientifiction' I mean the Jules Verne, H. G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe type of story—a charming romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision. Not only do these amazing tales make tremendously interesting reading—they are always instructive. They supply knowledge. in a very palatable form. New adventures pictured for us in the scientifiction of today are not at all impossible of realization tomorrow. Many great science stories destined to be of historical interest are still to be written. Posterity will point to them as having blazed a new trail, not only in literature and fiction, but progress as well. In, E. E. Doc Smith's first published work, The Skylark of Space, written in collaboration with Lee Hawkins Garby, appeared in Amazing Stories. It is often called the first great space opera. The same year, Philip Francis Nowlan's original Buck Rogers story, Armageddon, also appeared in Amazing Stories. This was followed by a Buck Rogers comic strip, the first serious science-fiction comic. In, John W. Campbell became editor of Astounding Science Fiction, an event which is sometimes considered the beginning of the Golden Age of Science Fiction, which is characterized by stories celebrating scientific achievement and progress. In, Isaac Asimov started his Foundation series, which chronicles the rise and fall of galactic empires and introduced psychohistory. The series was later awarded a one-time Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series. The Golden Age is often said to have ended in, but sometimes the late s and the s are included. Theodore Sturgeon's More Than Human explored possible future human evolution. In, Andromeda: A Space-Age Tale by the Russian writer and paleontologist Ivan Yefremov presented a view of a future interstellar communist civilization and is considered one of the most important Soviet science fiction novels. In, Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers marked a departure from his earlier juvenile stories and novels. It is one of the first and most influential examples of military science fiction, and introduced the concept of powered armor exoskeletons. The German space opera series Perry Rhodan, written by various authors, started in with an account of the first Moon landing and has since expanded in space to multiple universes, and in time by billions of years. It has become the most popular science fiction book series of all time. In the s and, New Wave science fiction was known for its embrace of a high degree of experimentation, both in form and in content, and a highbrow and self-consciously literary or artistic sensibility. In, Solaris by Stanisław Lem was published in Poland. The novel dealt with the theme of human limitations as its characters attempted to study a seemingly intelligent ocean on a newly discovered planet. 's Dune by Frank Herbert featured a much more complex and detailed imagined future society than had previous science fiction. In Anne McCaffrey began her Dragonriders of Pern science fantasy series. Two of the novellas included in the first novel, Dragonflight, made McCaffrey the first woman to win a Hugo or Nebula Award. In, Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was published. It is the literary source of the Blade Runner movie franchise. 's The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin was set on a planet in which the inhabitants have no fixed gender. It is one of the most influential examples of social science fiction, feminist science fiction, and anthropological science fiction. In, Science Fiction World began publication in the People's Republic of China. It dominates the Chinese science fiction magazine market, at one time claiming a circulation of, copies per issue and an estimated - readers per copy giving it a total estimated readership of at least million, making it the world's most popular science fiction periodical. In, William Gibson's first novel, Neuromancer, helped popularize cyberpunk and the word cyberspace, a term he originally coined in his short story Burning Chrome. In, Shards of Honor by Lois McMaster Bujold began her Vorkosigan Saga. 's Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson predicted immense social upheaval due to the information revolution. In, Liu Cixin's novel, The Three-Body Problem, was published in China. It was translated into English by Ken Liu and published by Tor Books in, and won the Hugo Award for Best Novel, making Liu the first Asian writer to win the award. Emerging themes in late th and early st century science fiction include environmental issues, the implications of the Internet and the expanding information universe, questions about biotechnology, nanotechnology, and post-scarcity societies. Recent trends and subgenres include steampunk, biopunk, and mundane science fiction. Film Main articles: Science fiction film and Lists of science fiction films The Maschinenmensch from Metropolis The first, or at least one of the first, recorded science fiction film is 's A Trip to the Moon, directed by French filmmaker Georges Méliès. It was profoundly influential on later filmmakers, bringing a different kind of creativity and fantasy to the cinematic medium. In addition, Méliès's innovative editing and special effects techniques were widely imitated and became important elements of the medium. 's Metropolis, directed by Fritz Lang, is the first feature-length science fiction film. Though not well received in its time, it is now considered a great and influential film. In, Godzilla, directed by Ishirō Honda, began the kaiju subgenre of science fiction film, which feature large creatures of any form, usually attacking a major city or engaging other monsters in battle. 's : A Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on the work of Arthur C. Clarke, rose above the mostly B-movie offerings up to that time both in scope and quality, and greatly influenced later science fiction films. That same year, Planet of the Apes the original, directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and based on the French novel La Planète des Singes by Pierre Boulle, was released to popular and critical acclaim, due in large part to its vivid depiction of a post-apocalyptic world in which intelligent apes dominate humans. In, George Lucas began the Star Wars film series with the film now identified as Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope. The series, often called a space opera, went on to become a worldwide popular culture phenomenon, and the second-highest-grossing film series of all time. Since the, science fiction films, along with fantasy, horror, and superhero films, have dominated Hollywood's big-budget productions. Science fiction films often cross-over with other genres, including animation WALL-E, Big Hero, gangster Sky Racket, Western Serenity, comedy Spaceballs, Galaxy Quest, war Enemy Mine, action Edge of Tomorrow, The Matrix, adventure Jupiter Ascending, Interstellar, sports Rollerball, mystery Minority Report, thriller Ex Machina, horror Alien, film noir Blade Runner, superhero Marvel Cinematic Universe -, drama Melancholia, Predestination, and romance Her Television Main articles: Science fiction on television and List of science fiction television programs Don Hastings left and Al Hodge in Captain Video and His Video Rangers Science fiction and television have consistently been in a close relationship. Television or television-like technologies frequently appeared in science fiction long before television itself became widely available in the late s and early s. The first known science fiction television program was a thirty-five-minute adapted excerpt of the play RUR, written by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek, broadcast live from the BBC's Alexandra Palace studios on February. The first popular science fiction program on American television was the children's adventure serial Captain Video and His Video Rangers, which ran from June to April. The Twilight Zone the original series, produced and narrated by Rod Serling, who also wrote or co-wrote most of the episodes, ran from to. It featured fantasy, suspense, and horror as well as science fiction, with each episode being a complete story. Critics have ranked it as one of the best TV programs of any genre. The animated series The Jetsons, while intended as comedy and only running for one season –, predicted many inventions now in common use: flat-screen televisions, newspapers on a computer-like screen, computer viruses, video chat, tanning beds, home treadmills, and more. In, the time travel-themed Doctor Who premiered on BBC Television. The original series ran until and was revived in. It has been extremely popular worldwide and has greatly influenced later TV science fiction. Other programs in the s included The Outer Limits, Lost in Space, and The Prisoner. Star Trek the original series, created by Gene Roddenberry, premiered in on NBC Television and ran for three seasons. It combined elements of space opera and Space Western. Only mildly successful at first, the series gained popularity through syndication and extraordinary fan interest. It became a very popular and influential franchise with many films, television shows, novels, and other works and products. Star Trek: The Next Generation - led to five additional live action Star Trek shows Deep Space, Voyager, Enterprise, Discovery –present, and Picard -present -- with more in some form of development. The miniseriespremiered in on NBC. It depicted an attempted takeover of Earth by reptilian aliens. Red Dwarf, a comic science fiction series aired on BBC Two between and, and on Dave since. The X-Files, which featured UFOs and conspiracy theories, was created by Chris Carter and broadcast by Fox Broadcasting Company from to, and again from to. Stargate, a film about ancient astronauts and interstellar teleportation, was released in. Stargate SG- premiered in and ran for seasons Spin-off series included Stargate Infinity, Stargate Atlantis, and Stargate Universe Other s series included Quantum Leap - and Babylon SyFy, launched in as The Sci-Fi Channel, specializes in science fiction, supernatural horror, and fantasy. Orphan Black began its season run in, about a woman who assumes the identity of one of her several genetically identical human clones. In December of the same year debuted Rick and Morty, an adult animated sci-fi series following the outer space and across dimensions misadventures of a cynical mad scientist and his good-hearted but fretful grandson. In late SyFy premiered The Expanse to great critical acclaim, an American TV series about Humanity's colonization of the Solar System. Its later seasons would then be aired through Amazon Prime Video. Social influence Science fiction's rapid rise in popularity during the first half of the century was closely tied to the popular respect paid to science at that time, as well as the rapid pace of technological innovation and new inventions. Science fiction has often predicted scientific and technological progress. Some works predict that new inventions and progress will tend to improve life and society, for instance the stories of Arthur C. Clarke and Star Trek. Others, such as H. G. Wells's The Time Machine and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, warn about possible negative consequences. In the National Science Foundation conducted a survey on Public Attitudes and Public Understanding: Science Fiction and Pseudoscience. It found that people who read or prefer science fiction may think about or relate to science differently than other people. They also tend to support the space program and the idea of contacting extraterrestrial civilizations. Carl Sagan wrote: Many scientists deeply involved in the exploration of the solar system myself among them were first turned in that direction by science fiction. Brian Aldiss described science fiction as cultural wallpaper. Evidence for this widespread influence can be found in trends for writers to employ science fiction as a tool for advocacy and generating cultural insights, as well as for educators when teaching across a range of academic disciplines not limited to the natural sciences. Scholar and science fiction critic George Edgar Slusser said that science fiction is the one real international literary form we have today, and as such has branched out to visual media, interactive media and on to whatever new media the world will invent in the st century. Crossover issues between the sciences and the humanities are crucial for the century to come. As protest literature Further information: Political ideas in science fiction and Social novel Happy in Spanish or Portuguese, referencing George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, on a standing piece of the Berlin Wall sometime after Science fiction has sometimes been used as a means of social protest. George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is an important work of dystopian science fiction. It is often invoked in protests against governments and leaders who are seen as totalitarian. James Cameron's film Avatar was intended as a protest against imperialism, and specifically the European colonization of the Americas. Robots, artificial humans, human clones, intelligent computers, and their possible conflicts with human society have all been major themes of science fiction since, at least, the publication of Shelly's Frankenstein. Some critics have seen this as reflecting authors concerns over the social alienation seen in modern society. Feminist science fiction poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles, the role reproduction plays in defining gender, and the inequitable political or personal power of one gender over others. Some works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or dystopias to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue. Climate fiction, or cli-fi, deals with issues concerning climate change and global warming. University courses on literature and environmental issues may include climate change fiction in their syllabi, and it is often discussed by other media outside of science fiction fandom. Libertarian science fiction focuses on the politics and social order implied by right libertarian philosophies with an emphasis on individualism and private property, and in some cases anti-statism. Science fiction comedy often satirizes and criticizes present-day society, and sometimes makes fun of the conventions and clichés of more serious science fiction. Sense of wonder Main article: Sense of wonder Further information: Wonder emotion Science fiction is often said to inspire a sense of wonder. Science fiction editor and critic David Hartwell wrote: Science fictions appeal lies in combination of the rational, the believable, with the miraculous. It is an appeal to the sense of wonder. Carl Sagan said: One of the great benefits of science fiction is that it can convey bits and pieces, hints, and phrases, of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader.  works you ponder over as the water is running out of the bathtub or as you walk through the woods in an early winter snowfall. In, Isaac Asimov commented on the changes then occurring in the science fiction community: And because todays real life so resembles day-before-yesterdays fantasy, the old-time fans are restless. Deep within, whether they admit it or not, is a feeling of disappointment and even outrage that the outer world has invaded their private domain. They feel the loss of a 'sense of wonder' because what was once truly confined to 'wonder' has now become prosaic and mundane. Science fiction studies Main article: Science fiction studies The study of science fiction, or science fiction studies, is the critical assessment, interpretation, and discussion of science fiction literature, film, TV shows, new media, fandom, and fan fiction. Science fiction scholars study science fiction to better understand it and its relationship to science, technology, politics, other genres, and culture-at-large. Science fiction studies began around the turn of the century, but it was not until later that science fiction studies solidified as a discipline with the publication of the academic journals Extrapolation, Foundation: The International Review of Science Fiction, and Science Fiction Studies, and the establishment of the oldest organizations devoted to the study of science fiction in, the Science Fiction Research Association and the Science Fiction Foundation. The field has grown considerably since the s with the establishment of more journals, organizations, and conferences, as well as science fiction degree-granting programs such as those offered by the University of Liverpool and the University of Kansas. Classification Further information: Hard science fiction and Soft science fiction Science fiction has historically been sub-divided between hard science fiction and soft science fiction, with the division centering on the feasibility of the science central to the story. However, this distinction has come under increasing scrutiny in the st century. Some authors, such as Tade Thompson and Jeff VanderMeer, have pointed out that stories that focus explicitly on physics, astronomy, mathematics, and engineering tend to be considered hard science fiction, while stories that focus on botany, mycology, zoology, and the social sciences tend to be categorized as soft, regardless of the relative rigor of the science. Max Gladstone defined hard science fiction as stories where the math works, but pointed out that this ends up with stories that often seem weirdly dated, as scientific paradigms shift over time. Michael Swanwick dismissed the traditional definition of hard SF altogether, instead saying that it was defined by characters striving to solve problems in the right way–with determination, a touch of stoicism, and the consciousness that the universe is not on his or her side. Ursula K. Le Guin also criticized the more traditional view on the difference between hard and soft SF: The 'hard' science fiction writers dismiss everything except, well, physics, astronomy, and maybe chemistry. Biology, sociology, anthropology—that's not science to them, that's soft stuff. They're not that interested in what human beings do, really. But I am. I draw on the social sciences a great deal. As serious literature Further information: Literature and Literary fiction Engraving showing a naked man awaking on the floor and another man fleeing in horror. A skull and a book are next to the naked man and a window, with the moon shining through it, is in the background Illustration by Theodor von Holst for edition of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein Respected authors have written science fiction. Mary Shelley wrote a number of science fiction novels including Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, and is considered a major writer of the Romantic Age. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is often listed as one of England's most important novels, both for its criticism of modern culture and its prediction of future trends including reproductive technology and social engineering. Kurt Vonnegut was a highly respected American author whose works contain science fiction premises or themes. Other science fiction authors whose works are widely considered to be serious literature include Ray Bradbury including, especially, Fahrenheit and The Martian Chronicles, Arthur C. Clarke especially for Childhood's End, and Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger, writing under the name Cordwainer Smith. In his book The Western Canon, literary critic Harold Bloom includes Brave New World, Solaris, Cat's Cradle by Vonnegut, and The Left Hand of Darkness as culturally and aesthetically significant works of western literature. David Barnett has pointed out that there are books such as The Road by Cormac McCarthy, Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell, The Gone-Away World by Nick Harkaway, The Stone Gods by Jeanette Winterson, and Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood, which use recognizable science fiction tropes, but whose authors and publishers do not market them as science fiction. Doris Lessing, who was later awarded the Nobel Prize in literature, wrote a series of five SF novels, Canopus in Argos: Archives, which depict the efforts of more advanced species and civilizations to influence those less advanced, including humans on Earth. In her much reprinted essay Science Fiction and Mrs Brown, Ursula K. Le Guin was asked: Can a science fiction writer write a novel? She answered: I believe that all novels.  deal with character, and that it is to express character–not to preach doctrines or sing songs. that the form of the novel, so clumsy, verbose, and undramatic, so rich, elastic, and alive, has been evolved  The great novelists have brought us to see whatever they wish us to see through some character. Otherwise, they would not be novelists, but poets, historians, or pamphleteers. Orson Scott Card, best known for his science fiction novel Ender's Game, has postulated that in science fiction the message and intellectual significance of the work are contained within the story itself and, therefore, does not need stylistic gimmicks or literary games. Jonathan Lethem, in a essay in the Village Voice entitled Close Encounters: The Squandered Promise of Science Fiction, suggested that the point in when Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow was nominated for the Nebula Award and was passed over in favor of Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama, stands as a hidden tombstone marking the death of the hope that SF was about to merge with the mainstream. In the same year science fiction author and physicist Gregory Benford wrote: SF is perhaps the defining genre of the twentiecentury, although its conquering armies are still camped outside the Rome of the literary citadels. Community Authors See also: List of science fiction authors Science fiction is being written, and has been written, by diverse authors from around the world. According to statistics by the science fiction publisher Tor Books, men outnumber women by to among submissions to the publisher. A controversy about voting slates in the Hugo Awards highlighted tensions in the science fiction community between a trend of increasingly diverse works and authors being honored by awards, and reaction by groups of authors and fans who preferred what they considered more traditional science fiction. Awards Main article: List of science fiction awards Among the most respected and well-known awards for science fiction are the Hugo Award for literature, presented by the World Science Fiction Society at Worldcon, and voted on by fans; the Nebula Award for literature, presented by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, and voted on by the community of authors; the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, presented by a jury of writers; and the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award for short fiction, presented by a jury. One notable award for science fiction films and TV programs is the Saturn Award, which is presented annually by The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Films. There are other national awards, like Canada's Prix Aurora Awards, regional awards, like the Endeavour Award presented at Orycon for works from the U. S. Pacific Northwest, and special interest or subgenre awards such as the Chesley Award for art, presented by the Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists, or the World Fantasy Award for fantasy. Magazines may organize reader polls, notably the Locus Award. Conventions Main article: Science fiction convention Writer Pamela Dean reading at the Minneapolis convention known as Minicon in Conventions in fandom, often shortened as cons, such as comic-con are held in cities around the world, catering to a local, regional, national, or international membership. General-interest conventions cover all aspects of science fiction, while others focus on a particular interest like media fandom, filking, and so on. Most science fiction conventions are organized by volunteers in non-profit groups, though most media-oriented events are organized by commercial promoters. Fandom and fanzines Main articles: Science fiction fandom and Science-fiction fanzine Science fiction fandom emerged from the letters column in Amazing Stories magazine. Soon fans began writing letters to each other, and then grouping their comments together in informal publications that became known as fanzines. Once they were in regular contact, fans wanted to meet each other, and they organized local clubs. In the, the first science fiction conventions gathered fans from a wider area. The earliest organized online fandom was the SF Lovers Community, originally a mailing list in the late s with a text archive file that was updated regularly. In the, Usenet groups greatly expanded the circle of fans online. In the, the development of the World-Wide Web exploded the community of online fandom by orders of magnitude, with thousands and then millions of websites devoted to science fiction and related genres for all media. The first science fiction fanzine, The Comet, was published in by the Science Correspondence Club in Chicago, Illinois.

const cyber = `Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting that tends to focus on a combination of lowlife and high tech, featuring futuristic technological and scientific achievements, such as artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with societal collapse or decay. Much of cyberpunk is rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement of the s and, when writers like Philip K. Dick, Michael Moorcock, Roger Zelazny, John Brunner, J. G. Ballard, Philip José Farmer and Harlan Ellison examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction. Comics exploring cyberpunk themes began appearing as early as Judge Dredd, first published in. Released in, William Gibson's influential debut novel Neuromancer helped solidify cyberpunk as a genre, drawing influence from punk subculture and early hacker culture. Other influential cyberpunk writers included Bruce Sterling and Rudy Rucker. The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in with the debut of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga series Akira, with its anime film adaptation also directed by Otomo later popularizing the subgenre. Early films in the genre include Ridley Scott's film Blade Runner, one of several of Philip K. Dick's works that have been adapted into films in this case, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. The first cyberpunk television series was the TV series Max Headroom from, playing in a futuristic dystopia ruled by an oligarchy of television networks, and where computer hacking played a central role in many story lines. The films Johnny Mnemonic and New Rose Hotel, both based upon short stories by William Gibson, flopped commercially and critically, while The Matrix trilogy – and Judge Dredd were some of the most successful cyberpunk films. Newer cyberpunk media includes Blade Runner, a sequel to the original film, as well as Upgrade, Dredd which was not a sequel to the original movie, Alita: Battle Angel based on the s Japanese manga Battle Angel Alita, the Netflix TV series Altered Carbon based on Richard K. Morgan's novel of the same name, the remake of role-playing video game Final Fantasy VII, and the video game Cyberpunk based on R. Talsorian Games's tabletop role-playing game Cyberpunk. Background Lawrence Person has attempted to define the content and ethos of the cyberpunk literary movement stating: Classic cyberpunk characters were marginalized, alienated loners who lived on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures where daily life was impacted by rapid technological change, an ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information, and invasive modification of the human body. — Lawrence Person Cyberpunk plots often center on conflict among artificial intelligences, hackers, and megacorporations, and tend to be set in a near-future Earth, rather than in the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as Isaac Asimov's Foundation or Frank Herbert's Dune. The settings are usually post-industrial dystopias but tend to feature extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its original inventors the street finds its own uses for things. Much of the genre's atmosphere echoes film noir, and written works in the genre often use techniques from detective fiction. There are sources who view that cyberpunk has shifted from a literary movement to a mode of science fiction due to the limited number of writers and its transition to a more generalized cultural formation. History and origins The origins of cyberpunk are rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement of the s and, where New Worlds, under the editorship of Michael Moorcock, began inviting and encouraging stories that examined new writing styles, techniques, and archetypes. Reacting to conventional storytelling, New Wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. Writers like Roger Zelazny, J. G. Ballard, Philip Jose Farmer, Samuel R. Delany, and Harlan Ellison often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution with an avant-garde style influenced by the Beat Generation especially William S. Burroughs' own SF, Dadaism, and their own ideas. Ballard attacked the idea that stories should follow the archetypes popular since the time of Ancient Greece, and the assumption that these would somehow be the same ones that would call to modern readers, as Joseph Campbell argued in The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Instead, Ballard wanted to write a new myth for the modern reader, a style with more psycho-literary ideas, more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the sombre half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics. This had a profound influence on a new generation of writers, some of whom would come to call their movement cyberpunk. One, Bruce Sterling, later said: In the circle of American science fiction writers of my generation — cyberpunks and humanists and so forth — Ballard was a towering figure. We used to have bitter struggles over who was more Ballardian than whom. We knew we were not fit to polish the mans boots, and we were scarcely able to understand how we could get to a position to do work which he might respect or stand, but at least we were able to see the peak of achievement that he had reached. Ballard, Zelazny, and the rest of New Wave was seen by the subsequent generation as delivering more realism to science fiction, and they attempted to build on this. citation needed Samuel R. Delany's novel Nova is also considered one of the major forerunners of the cyberpunk movement. It prefigures, for instance, cyberpunk's staple trope of human interfacing with computers via implants. Writer William Gibson claimed to be greatly influenced by Delany, and his novel Neuromancer includes allusions to Nova. citation needed Similarly influential, and generally cited as proto-cyberpunkby whom? is the Philip K. Dick novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, first published in. Presenting precisely the general feeling of dystopian post-economic-apocalyptic future as Gibson and Sterling later deliver, it examines ethical and moral problems with cybernetic, artificial intelligence in a way more realist than the Isaac Asimov Robot series that laid its philosophical foundation. Dick's protege and friend K. W. Jeter wrote a novel called Dr. Adder in that, Dick lamented, might have been more influential in the field had it been able to find a publisher at that time. citation needed It was not published until, after which Jeter made it the first book in a trilogy, followed by The Glass Hammer and Death Arms. Jeter wrote other standalone cyberpunk novels before going on to write three authorized sequels to Do Androids Dream of electric sheep, named Blade Runner : The Edge of Human, Blade Runner : Replicant Night, and Blade Runner : Eye and Talon. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep was made into the seminal movie Blade Runner, released in. This was one year after William Gibson's story, Johnny Mnemonic helped move proto-cyberpunk concepts into the mainstream. That story, which also became a film years later in, involves another dystopian future, where human couriers deliver computer data, stored cybernetically in their own minds. The term cyberpunk first appeared as the title of a short story written by Bruce Bethke, written in and published in Amazing Stories in. It was picked up by Gardner Dozois, editor of Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine and popularized in his editorials. Bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology. He described the idea thus: The kids who trashed my computer; their kids were going to be Holy Terrors, combining the ethical vacuity of teenagers with a technical fluency we adults could only guess at. Further, the parents and other adult authority figures of the early st Century were going to be terribly ill-equipped to deal with the first generation of teenagers who grew up truly speaking computer. Afterward, Dozois began using this term in his own writing, most notably in a Washington Post article where he said About the closest thing here to a self-willed esthetic 'school' would be the purveyors of bizarre hard-edged, high-tech stuff, who have on occasion been referred to as 'cyberpunks' — Sterling, Gibson, Shiner, Cadigan, Bear. About that time in, William Gibson's novel Neuromancer was published, delivering a glimpse of a future encompassed by what became an archetype of cyberpunk virtual reality, with the human mind being fed light-based worldscapes through a computer interface. Some, perhaps ironically including Bethke himself, argued at the time that the writers whose style Gibson's books epitomized should be called Neuromantics, a pun on the name of the novel plus New Romantics, a term used for a New Wave pop music movement that had just occurred in Britain, but this term did not catch on. Bethke later paraphrased Michael Swanwick's argument for the term: the movement writers should properly be termed neuromantics, since so much of what they were doing was clearly imitating Neuromancer. Sterling was another writer who played a central role, often consciously, in the cyberpunk genre, variously seen as either keeping it on track, or distorting its natural path into a stagnant formula. In he edited a volume of cyberpunk stories called Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology, an attempt to establish what cyberpunk was, from Sterling's perspective. In the subsequent decade, the motifs of Gibson's Neuromancer became formulaic, climaxing in the satirical extremes of Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash in. Bookending the cyberpunk era, Bethke himself published a novel in called Headcrash, like Snow Crash a satirical attack on the genre's excesses. Fittingly, it won an honor named after cyberpunk's spiritual founder, the Philip K. Dick Award. It satirized the genre in this way:,full of young guys with no social lives, no sex lives and no hope of ever moving out of their mothers' basements,They're total wankers and losers who indulge in Messianic fantasies about someday getting even with the world through almost-magical computer skills, but whose actual use of the Net amounts to dialing up the scatophilia forum and downloading a few disgusting pictures. You know, cyberpunks. The impact of cyberpunk, though, has been long-lasting. Elements of both the setting and storytelling have become normal in science fiction in general, and a slew of sub-genres now have -punk tacked onto their names, most obviously steampunk, but also a host of other cyberpunk derivatives. Style and ethos Primary figures in the cyberpunk movement include William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Bruce Sterling, Bruce Bethke, Pat Cadigan, Rudy Rucker, and John Shirley. Philip K. Dick author of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, from which the film Blade Runner was adapted is also seen by some as prefiguring the movement. Blade Runner can be seen as a quintessential example of the cyberpunk style and theme. Video games, board games, and tabletop role-playing games, such as Cyberpunk and Shadowrun, often feature storylines that are heavily influenced by cyberpunk writing and movies. Beginning in the early, some trends in fashion and music were also labeled as cyberpunk. Cyberpunk is also featured prominently in anime and manga Japanese cyberpunk, with Akira, Ghost in the Shell and Cowboy Bebop being among the most notable. Setting Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan the latter three images depict the Shibuya Crossing. About Japan's influence in the s on the genre, William Gibson said, modern Japan simply was cyberpunk. Cyberpunk writers tend to use elements from crime fiction—particularly hardboiled detective fiction and film noir—and postmodernist prose to describe an often nihilistic underground side of an electronic society. The genre's vision of a troubled future is often called the antithesis of the generally utopian visions of the future popular in the s and s. Gibson defined cyberpunk's antipathy towards utopian SF in his short story The Gernsback Continuum, which pokes fun at and, to a certain extent, condemns utopian science fiction. In some cyberpunk writing, much of the action takes place online, in cyberspace, blurring the line between actual and virtual reality. A typical trope in such work is a direct connection between the human brain and computer systems. Cyberpunk settings are dystopias with corruption, computers and internet connectivity. Giant, multinational corporations have for the most part replaced governments as centers of political, economic, and even military power. The economic and technological state of Japan is a regular theme in the cyberpunk literature of the s. Of Japan's influence on the genre, William Gibson said, Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk. Cyberpunk is often set in urbanized, artificial landscapes, and city lights, receding was used by Gibson as one of the genre's first metaphors for cyberspace and virtual reality. The cityscapes of Hong Kong has had major influences in the urban backgrounds, ambiance and settings in many cyberpunk works such as Blade Runner and Shadowrun. Ridley Scott envisioned the landscape of cyberpunk Los Angeles in Blade Runner to be Hong Kong on a very bad day. The streetscapes of the Ghost in the Shell film were based on Hong Kong. Its director Mamoru Oshii felt that Hong Kong's strange and chaotic streets where old and new exist in confusing relationships, fit the theme of the film well. Hong Kong's Kowloon Walled City is particularly notable for its disorganized hyper-urbanization and breakdown in traditional urban planning to be an inspiration to cyberpunk landscapes. Portrayals of East Asia and Asians in Western cyberpunk have been criticized as Orientalist and promoting racist tropes playing on American and European fears of East Asian dominance; this has been referred to as techno-Orientalism. Protagonists One of the cyberpunk genre's prototype characters is Case, from Gibson's Neuromancer. Case is a console cowboy, a brilliant hacker who has betrayed his organized criminal partners. Robbed of his talent through a crippling injury inflicted by the vengeful partners, Case unexpectedly receives a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be healed by expert medical care but only if he participates in another criminal enterprise with a new crew. Like Case, many cyberpunk protagonists are manipulated, placed in situations where they have little or no choice, and although they might see things through, they do not necessarily come out any further ahead than they previously were. This emphasis on the misfits and the malcontents is the punk component of cyberpunk. Society and government Cyberpunk can be intended to disquiet readers and call them to action. It often expresses a sense of rebellion, suggesting that one could describe it as a type of cultural revolution in science fiction. In the words of author and critic David Brin:,a closer look at cyberpunk authors reveals that they nearly always portray future societies in which governments have become wimpy and pathetic,Popular science fiction tales by Gibson, Williams, Cadigan and others do depict Orwellian accumulations of power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate elite. Cyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the evolution of the Internet. The earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the World Wide Web entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers such as Arthur C. Clarke and some social commentators such as James Burke began predicting that such networks would eventually form. Some observers cite that cyberpunk tends to marginalize sectors of society such as women and Africans. It is claimed that, for instance, cyberpunk depicts fantasies that ultimately empower masculinity using fragmentary and decentered aesthetic that culminate in a masculine genre populated by male outlaws. Critics also note the absence of any reference to Africa or an African-American character in the quintessential cyberpunk film Blade Runner while other films reinforce stereotypes. Media Literature See also: List of cyberpunk works § Print media, and Cyborgs in fiction Minnesota writer Bruce Bethke coined the term in for his short story Cyberpunk, which was published in an issue of Amazing Science Fiction Stories. The term was quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Pat Cadigan and others. Of these, Sterling became the movement's chief ideologue, thanks to his fanzine Cheap Truth. John Shirley wrote articles on Sterling and Rucker's significance. John Brunner's novel The Shockwave Rider is considered by manywho? to be the first cyberpunk novel with many of the tropes commonly associated with the genre, some five years before the term was popularized by Dozois. William Gibson with his novel Neuromancer is arguably the most famous writer connected with the term cyberpunk. He emphasized style, a fascination with surfaces, and atmosphere over traditional science-fiction tropes. Regarded as ground-breaking and sometimes as the archetypal cyberpunk work, Neuromancer was awarded the Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K. Dick Awards. Count Zero and Mona Lisa Overdrive followed after Gibson's popular debut novel. According to the Jargon File, Gibson's near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly naïve and tremendously stimulating. Early on, cyberpunk was hailed as a radical departure from science-fiction standards and a new manifestation of vitality. Shortly thereafter, however, some critics arose to challenge its status as a revolutionary movement. These critics said that the SF New Wave of the s was much more innovative as far as narrative techniques and styles were concerned. Furthermore, while Neuromancer's narrator may have had an unusual voice for science fiction, much older examples can be found: Gibson's narrative voice, for example, resembles that of an updated Raymond Chandler, as in his novel The Big Sleep. Others noted that almost all traits claimed to be uniquely cyberpunk could in fact be found in older writers' works—often citing J. G. Ballard, Philip K. Dick, Harlan Ellison, Stanisław Lem, Samuel R. Delany, and even William S. Burroughs. For example, Philip K. Dick's works contain recurring themes of social decay, artificial intelligence, paranoia, and blurred lines between objective and subjective realities. The influential cyberpunk movie Blade Runner is based on his book, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. Humans linked to machines are found in Pohl and Kornbluth's Wolfbane and Roger Zelazny's Creatures of Light and Darkness. citation needed In, scholar Brian Stonehill suggested that Thomas Pynchon's novel Gravity's Rainbow not only curses but precurses what we now glibly dub cyberspace. Other important predecessors include Alfred Bester's two most celebrated novels, The Demolished Man and The Stars My Destination, as well as Vernor Vinge's novella True Names. Reception and impact Science-fiction writer David Brin describes cyberpunk as the finest free promotion campaign ever waged on behalf of science fiction. It may not have attracted the real punks, but it did ensnare many new readers, and it provided the sort of movement that postmodern literary critics found alluring. Cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive to academics, argues Brin; in addition, it made science fiction more profitable to Hollywood and to the visual arts generally. Although the self-important rhetoric and whines of persecution on the part of cyberpunk fans were irritating at worst and humorous at best, Brin declares that the rebels did shake things up. We owe them a debt. Fredric Jameson considers cyberpunk the supreme literary expression if not of postmodernism, then of late capitalism itself. Cyberpunk further inspired many professional writers who were not among the original cyberpunks to incorporate cyberpunk ideas into their own works, citation needed such as George Alec Effinger's When Gravity Fails. Wired magazine, created by Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe, mixes new technology, art, literature, and current topics in order to interest today's cyberpunk fans, which Paula Yoo claims proves that hardcore hackers, multimedia junkies, cyberpunks and cellular freaks are poised to take over the world. Film and television See also: List of cyberpunk works § Films, List of cyberpunk works § Television and Web Series, and Japanese cyberpunk The film Blade Runner —adapted from Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?—is set in in a dystopian future in which manufactured beings called replicants are slaves used on space colonies and are legal prey on Earth to various bounty hunters who retire kill them. Although Blade Runner was largely unsuccessful in its first theatrical release, it found a viewership in the home video market and became a cult film. Since the movie omits the religious and mythical elements of Dick's original novel e. g. empathy boxes and Wilbur Mercer, it falls more strictly within the cyberpunk genre than the novel does. William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision for Neuromancer, a book he was then working on. The film's tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as The Matrix trilogy, which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements. The number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since Blade Runner. Several of Philip K. Dick's works have been adapted to the silver screen. The films Johnny Mnemonic and New Rose Hotel, both based upon short stories by William Gibson, flopped commercially and critically. These box offices misses significantly slowed the development of cyberpunk as a literary or cultural form although a sequel to the film Blade Runner was released in October with Harrison Ford reprising his role from the original film. A rigorously implementation of all core cyberpunk hallmarks is the TV series Max Headroom from, playing in a futuristic dystopia ruled by an oligarchy of television networks, and where computer hacking played a central role in many story lines. Max Headroom has been called the first cyberpunk television series, with deep roots in the Western philosophical tradition. In addition, tech-noir film as a hybrid genre, means a work of combining neo-noir and science fiction or cyberpunk. It includes many cyberpunk films such as Blade Runner, Burst City, Robocop, Monkeys, The Lawnmower Man, Hackers, Hardware, and Strange Days. Anime and manga Main article: Japanese cyberpunk See also: List of cyberpunk works § Animation, and List of cyberpunk works § Graphic novels and comics The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in with the debut of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga series Akira, with its anime film adaptation, which Otomo directed, later popularizing the subgenre. Akira inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and anime series such as Ghost in the Shell, Battle Angel Alita, Cowboy Bebop, and Serial Experiments Lain. Other early Japanese cyberpunk works include the film Burst City, the original video animation Megazone, and the film Tetsuo: The Iron Man. In contrast to Western cyberpunk which has roots in New Wave science fiction literature, Japanese cyberpunk has roots in underground music culture, specifically the Japanese punk subculture that arose from the Japanese punk music scene in the s. The filmmaker Sogo Ishii introduced this subculture to Japanese cinema with the punk film Panic High School and the punk biker film Crazy Thunder Road, both portraying the rebellion and anarchy associated with punk, and the latter featuring a punk biker gang aesthetic. Ishii's punk films paved the way for Otomo's seminal cyberpunk work Akira. Cyberpunk themes are widely visible in anime and manga. In Japan, where cosplay is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson's Neuromancer, whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in Chiba, one of Japan's largest industrial areas, although at the time of writing the novel Gibson did not know the location of Chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision in some ways. The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture. Cyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with Western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. It is a culture that does not exist right now, so the Japanese concept of a cyberpunk future, seems just as valid as a Western one, especially as Western cyberpunk often incorporates many Japanese elements. William Gibson is now a frequent visitor to Japan, and he came to see that many of his visions of Japan have become a reality: Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk. The Japanese themselves knew it and delighted in it. I remember my first glimpse of Shibuya, when one of the young Tokyo journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns—all that towering, animated crawl of commercial information—said, You see? You see? It is Blade Runner town. And it was. It so evidently was. Cyberpunk themes have appeared in many anime and manga, including the ground-breaking Appleseed, Ghost in the Shell, Ergo Proxy, Megazone, Goku Midnight Eye, Cyber City Oedo, Bubblegum Crisis, A. D. Police: Dead End City, Angel Cop, Blame!, Armitage III, Texhnolyze, Psycho-Pass and No Guns Life. Influence Akira manga and its anime film adaptation have influenced numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games. Akira has been cited as a major influence on Hollywood films such as The Matrix, Chronicle, Looper, Midnight Special, and Inception, as well as cyberpunk-influenced video games such as Hideo Kojima's Snatcher and Metal Gear Solid, Valve's Half-Life series and Dontnod Entertainment's Remember Me. Akira has also influenced the work of musicians such as Kanye West, who paid homage to Akira in the Stronger music video, and Lupe Fiasco, whose album Tetsuo and Youth is named after Tetsuo Shima. The popular bike from the film, Kaneda's Motorbike, appears in Steven Spielberg's film Ready Player One, and CD Projekt's video game Cyberpunk. An interpretation of digital rain, similar to the images used in Ghost in the Shell and later in The Matrix. Ghost in the Shell influenced a number of prominent filmmakers, most notably the Wachowskis in The Matrix and its sequels. The Matrix series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain, which was inspired by the opening credits of Ghost in the Shell and a sushi magazine the wife of the senior designer of the animation, Simon Witheley, used to have it the kitchen at the time., and the way characters access the Matrix through holes in the back of their necks. Other parallels have been drawn to James Cameron's Avatar, Steven Spielberg's A. I. Artificial Intelligence, and Jonathan Mostow's Surrogates. James Cameron cited Ghost in the Shell as a source of inspiration, citing it as an influence on Avatar. The original video animation Megazone has a number of similarities to The Matrix. Battle Angel Alita has had a notable influence on filmmaker James Cameron, who was planning to adapt it into a film since. It was an influence on his TV series Dark Angel, and he is the producer of the film adaptation Alita: Battle Angel. Comics In, artist Moebius collaborated with writer Dan O'Bannon on a story called The Long Tomorrow, published in the French magazine Métal Hurlant. One of the first works featuring elements now seen as exemplifying cyberpunk, it combined influences from film noir and hardboiled crime fiction with a distant sci-fi environment. Author William Gibson stated that Moebius' artwork for the series, along with other visuals from Métal Hurlant, strongly influenced his novel Neuromancer. The series had a far-reaching impact in the cyberpunk genre, being cited as an influence on Ridley Scott's Alien and Blade Runner. Moebius later expanded upon The Long Tomorrow's aesthetic with The Incal, a graphic novel collaboration with Alejandro Jodorowsky published from to. The story centers around the exploits of a detective named John Difool in various science fiction settings, and while not confined to the tropes of cyberpunk, it features many elements of the genre. Concurrently with many other foundational cyberpunk works, DC Comics published Frank Miller's six-issue miniseries Rōnin from to. The series, incorporating aspects of Samurai culture, martial arts films and manga, is set in a dystopian near-future New York. It explores the link between an ancient Japanese warrior and the apocalyptic, crumbling cityscape he finds himself in. The comic also bears several similarities to Akira, with highly powerful telepaths playing central roles, as well as sharing many key visuals. Rōnin would go on to influence many later works, including Samurai Jack and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, as well as video games such as Cyberpunk. Two years later, Miller himself would incorporate several toned-down elements of Rōnin into his acclaimed miniseries The Dark Knight Returns, in which a retired Bruce Wayne once again takes up the mantle of Batman in a Gotham that is increasingly becoming more dystopian. Paul Pope's Batman: Year, published in, also exhibits several traits typical of cyberpunk fiction, such as a rebel protagonist opposing a future authoritarian state, and a distinct retrofuturist aesthetic that makes callbacks to both The Dark Knight Returns and Batman's original appearances in the s. Games See also: List of cyberpunk works § Video games, and List of cyberpunk works § Role-playing games There are many cyberpunk video games. Popular series include Final Fantasy VII and its spin-offs and remake, the Megami Tensei series, Kojima's Snatcher and Metal Gear series, Deus Ex series, Syndicate series, and System Shock and its sequel. Other games, like Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, and the Matrix series, are based upon genre movies, or role-playing games for instance the various Shadowrun games. Several RPGs called Cyberpunk exist: Cyberpunk, Cyberpunk, Cyberpunk, and Cyberpunk v, by R. Talsorian Games, and GURPS Cyberpunk, published by Steve Jackson Games as a module of the GURPS family of RPGs. Cyberpunk was designed with the settings of William Gibson's writings in mind, and to some extent with his approval, unlike the approach taken by FASA in producing the transgenre Shadowrun game and its various sequels. Both are set in the near future, in a world where cybernetics are prominent. In addition, Iron Crown Enterprises released an RPG named Cyberspace, which was out of print for several years until recently being re-released in online PDF form. CD Projekt Red released Cyberpunk, a cyberpunk open world first-person shooter/role-playing video game RPG based on the tabletop RPG Cyberpunk, on December. In, in a convergence of cyberpunk art and reality, the United States Secret Service raided Steve Jackson Games's headquarters and confiscated all their computers. Officials denied that the target had been the GURPS Cyberpunk sourcebook, but Jackson would later write that he and his colleagues were never able to secure the return of the complete manuscript;,The Secret Service at first flatly refused to return anything – then agreed to let us copy files, but when we got to their office, restricted us to one set of out-of-date files – then agreed to make copies for us, but said tomorrow every day from March to March. On March we received a set of disks which purported to be our files, but the material was late, incomplete and well-nigh useless. Steve Jackson Games won a lawsuit against the Secret Service, aided by the new Electronic Frontier Foundation. This event has achieved a sort of notoriety, which has extended to the book itself as well. All published editions of GURPS Cyberpunk have a tagline on the front cover, which reads The book that was seized by the U. S. Secret Service! Inside, the book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath. Cyberpunk has also inspired several tabletop, miniature and board games such as Necromunda by Games Workshop. Netrunner is a collectible card game introduced in, based on the Cyberpunk role-playing game. Tokyo NOVA, debuting in, is a cyberpunk role-playing game that uses playing cards instead of dice. Cyberpunk set a new record for the largest number of simultaneous players in a single player game, with a record, playing just after the December th launch, according to Steam Database. That tops the previous Steam record of, players set by Fallout back in. Music See also: List of cyberpunk works § Music Much of the industrial/dance heavy 'Cyberpunk'—recorded in Billy Idol's Macintosh-run studio—revolves around Idol's theme of the common man rising up to fight against a faceless, soulless, corporate world. —Julie Romandetta Invariably the origin of cyberpunk music lies in the synthesizer-heavy scores of cyberpunk films such as Escape from New York and Blade Runner. Some musicians and acts have been classified as cyberpunk due to their aesthetic style and musical content. Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include Psydoll, Front Line Assembly, Clock DVA, Angelspit and Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Albums such as the British musician and songwriter Gary Numan's Replicas, The Pleasure Principle and Telekon were heavily inspired by the works of Philip K. Dick. Kraftwerk's The Man-Machine and Computer World albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. Nine Inch Nails' concept album Year Zero also fits into this category. Fear Factory concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. Billy Idol's Cyberpunk drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the cyberdelic counter culture in its creation Outside, a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by David Bowie, was warmly met by critics upon its release in. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including Sonic Youth, whose albums Sister and Daydream Nation take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively. Madonna's Drowned World Tour opened with a cyberpunk section, where costumes, asethetics and stage props were used to accentuate the dystopian nature of the theatrical concert. Lady Gaga used a cyberpunk-persona and visual style for her sixth studio album Chromatica. Vaporwave and synthwave are also influenced by cyberpunk. The former has been inspired by one of the messages of cyberpunk and is interpreted as a dystopian critique of capitalism in the vein of cyberpunk and the latter is more surface-level, inspired only by the aesthetic of cyberpunk as a nostalgic retrofuturistic revival of aspects of cyberpunk's origins. Social impact Art and architecture Berlin's Sony Center, opened in, has been described as having a cyberpunk aesthetic Writers David Suzuki and Holly Dressel describe the cafes, brand-name stores and video arcades of the Sony Center in the Potsdamer Platz public square of Berlin, Germany, as a vision of a cyberpunk, corporate urban future. Society and counterculture Several subcultures have been inspired by cyberpunk fiction. These include the cyberdelic counter culture of the late s and early s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as cyberpunks, attempted to blend the psychedelic art and drug movement with the technology of cyberculture. Early adherents included Timothy Leary, Mark Frauenfelder and R. U. Sirius. The movement largely faded following the dot-com bubble implosion of. Cybergoth is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as rave and Gothic subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent yearswhen? which rejects the raver and goth influences of cybergoth, and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, post apocalypse, functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction. This fashion goes by names like tech wear, goth ninja or tech ninja. The Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong demolished in is often referenced as the model cyberpunk/dystopian slum as, given its poor living conditions at the time coupled with the city's political, physical, and economic isolation has caused many in academia to be fascinated by the ingenuity of its spawning. Related genres See also: Cyberpunk derivatives As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, some of which could be considered as playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as legitimate explorations into newer territory. These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is steampunk, which is set in an alternate history Victorian era that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak film noir world view. The term was originally coined around as a joke to describe some of the novels of Tim Powers, James P. Blaylock, and K. W. Jeter, but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their collaborative novel The Difference Engine the term was being used earnestly as well. Another subgenre is biopunk cyberpunk themes dominated by biotechnology from the early, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by genetic manipulation. Cyberpunk works have been described as well situated within postmodern literature.

const howl = `I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night, who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz, who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated, who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war, who were expelled from the academies for crazy and publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull, who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall, who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York, who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls, incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada and Paterson, illuminating all the

holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo, who sank all night in submarine light of Bickfords floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzis, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox, who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge, a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon, yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars, whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement, who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall, suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of China under junk-withdrawal in Newarks bleak furnished room, who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts, who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night, who studied Plotinus

streetlight smalltown rain, who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the brilliant Spaniard to converse about America and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to Africa, who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace Chicago, who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets, who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism, who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed, who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons, who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication, who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and

const poems = `Can I come in? I saw you slip away. Hors d'oeuvres depress you, don't they? They do me. And cocktails, jokes … such dutiful abandon. Where the faithful observe immovable feasts - boat races, birthdays, marriages, martyrdoms - we're summoned to our lonely ceremonies any time: minor, the mouldiness of an old encyclopedia, the tinny sun snapping off the playground swings, these are, though we can't know this, scheduled to arrive that minute of the hour, hour of the day, day of every year. Again, regular as brickwork comes the time the nurse jots on your chart before she pulls the sheet across your face. Just so the past falls open anywhere - even sitting here with you. Sorry. You remind me of a girl I knew. I met her at a party much like this, but younger, louder, the bass so fat, the night so sticky you could drown. We shouted at each other over soul and cold beer in the crowded kitchen and l, at least, was halfway to a kiss when she slipped her arm around her friend. I worked at liking him and it took work, and it never got any easier being harmless, but we danced that night like a three-way game of chess and sang to Curtis Mayfield pumped so loud that when I drove them home they could hardly whisper to invite me up. Their black walls smirked with Jesus on black velvet - Jesus, Elvis, Mexican skeletons, big-eyed Virgins, Rodin's hands clasped in chocolate prayer - an attitude of décor, not like this room of yours. A bottle opened - tequila with a cringe of worm - and she watched me. Lighting a meltdown of Paschal candles she watched me. He poured the drinks rasping We're seriously into cultural detritus. At which, at last, she smiled. Ice cubes cracked. The worm sank in my glass. And all that long year we were joined at the hip. I never heard them laugh. They had, instead, this tic of scratching quotes in the air - like frightened mimes inside their box of style, that first class carriage from whose bright window I watched the suburbs of my life recede. Exactly one year on she let me kiss her - once - her mouth wine-chilled, my tongue a clumsy guest, and after that the invitations dwindled. By Christmas we were strangers. It was chance I heard about the crash. He died at once. Black ice and rain they said. No news of her. I can't remember why I didn't write. Perhaps I thought she'd sold the flat and left. Some nights midway to sleep I'm six years old. Downstairs it's New Year's Eve. Drink and shrieks. But my mother's lit the luminous plastic Jesus to watch me through the night, which is why I've got my pillow wrapped around my head. I never hear the door. And when she speaks, her thick-tongued anger rearing like a beast I feel my hot piss spreading through the sheets. But when I wake, grown up, it's only sweat. But if I dream I bleed. A briar crown, a fist prised open wide, a steadied nail, a hammer swinging down - the past falls open anywhere… Ash Wednesday evening. Driving by, I saw her lights were on. I noticed both their names still on the buzzer and when I rang I heard her voice. Come in - her nose was broken, her front teeth gone, a rosary was twisted round her fists - - Come in. I've been saying a novena. Inside, each crucifix and candle shone, transfigured in her chrysalis of grief. She spoke about the crash, how she'd been driving, how they had to cut her from the wreck… and then she slipped and called me by his name. Of those next hours I remember most the silences between her sobs, the rain against the skylight slowly weakening to silence, silence brimming into sleep and dawn. Then, having lain at last all night beside her, having searched at last that black-walled room, the last unopened chamber of my heart, and found there neither pity nor desire but an assortment of religious kitsch, I inched my arm from under her and left. Since then, the calmest voice contains her cry just within the range of human hearing and where I've hoped to hear my name gasped out from cradle, love bed, death bed, there instead I catch her voice, her broken lisp, his name. Since then, each night contains all others, nested mirror-within-mirror, stretching back from then to here and now, this party, this room, this bed, where, in another life, we might have kissed. Thank you, my friend, for showing me your things - you have exquisite taste - but let's rejoin your guests who must by now be wondering where you've gone. The school-bell is a call to battle, every step to class, a step into the firing-line. Here is the target, fine skin at the temple, cheek still rounded from being fifteen. Surrendered, surrounded, she takes the bullet in the head and walks on. The missile cuts a pathway in her mind, to an orchard in full bloom, a field humming under the sun, its lap open and full of poppies. This girl has won the right to be ordinary, wear bangles to a wedding, paint her fingernails, go to school. Bullet, she says, you are stupid. You have failed. You cannot kill a book or the buzzing in it. A murmur, a swarm. Behind her, one by one, the schoolgirls are standing up to take their places on the front line. And if sometimes, on the steps of a palace or the green grass of a ditch, in the mournful solitude of your room, you wake again, drunkenness already diminishing or gone, ask the wind, the wave, the star, the bird, the clock, everything that is flying, everything that is groaning, everything that is rolling, everything that is singing, everything that is speaking. ask what time it is and wind, wave, star, bird, clock will answer you: It is time to be drunk! So as not to be the martyred slaves of time, be drunk, be continually drunk! On wine, on poetry or on virtue as you wish. On the map it is precise and rectilinear as a chessboard, though driving past you would hardly notice it, this boundary line or ragged margin, a shallow swale that cups a simple trickle of water, less rill than rivulet, more gully than dell, a tangled ditch grown up throughout with a fearsome assortment of wildflowers and bracken. There is no fence, though here and there a weathered post asserts a former claim, strands of fallen wire taken by the dust. To the left a cornfield carries into the distance, dips and rises to the blue sky, a rolling plain of green and healthy plants aligned in close order, row upon row upon row. The day is fresh-washed and fair, and there is a smell of tulips and narcissus in the air. The sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and planes of greenish-white. It cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel, and cracks it to bright light. Little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance, dance, and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling; a stir of my finger sets them whirring, reeling. I move a foot and the planes of light in the water jar. I lie back and laugh, and let the green-white water, the sun-flawed beryl water, flow over me. The day is almost too bright to bear, the green water covers me from the too bright day. I will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots. The sky is blue and high. A crow flaps by the window, and there is a whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air. Out of the golden West, out of the leaden East, into the iron South, and to the silver North.  Oh metals metals everywhere, forks and knives, belt buckles and hooks.  When you are beaten you sing. You do not give anyone a chance.  You come out of the earth and fly with men. You lodge in men. You hurt them terribly. You tear them. You do not care for anyone. Oh metals metals, why are you always hanging about? Is it not enough that you hold mens wrists? Is it not enough that we let you in our mouths? Why is it you will not do anything for yourself? Why is it you always wait for men to show you what to be?And men love you. Perhaps it is because you soften so often. You did, it is true, pour into anything men asked you to. It has always proved you to be somewhat softer than you really are. Oh metals metals, why are you always filling my house?You are like family, you do not care for anyone. This tree has two million and seventy-five thousand leaves. Perhaps I missed a leaf or two but I do feel triumphant at having persisted in counting by hand branch by branch and marked down on paper with pencil each total. Adding them up was a pleasure I could understand; I did something on my own that was not dependent on others, and to count leaves is not less meaningful than to count the stars, as astronomers are always doing. They want the facts to be sure they have them all. It would help them to know whether the world is finite. I discovered one tree that is finite. I must try counting the hairs on my head, and you too. We could swap information. Kills bugs dead. Redundancy is syntactical overkill. A pin-prick of peace at the end of the tunnel of a nightmare night in a roach motel. Their noise infects the dream. In black kitchens they foul the food, walk on our bodies as we sleep over oceans of pirate flags. Skull and crossbones, they crunch like candy. When we die they will eat us, unless we kill them first. Invest in better mousetraps. Take no prisoners on board ship, to rock the boat, to violate our beds with pestilence. We dream the dream of extirpation. Wipe out a species, with God at our side. Annihilate the insects. Sterilize the filthy vermin. America Ive given you all and now I'm nothing. America two dollars and twentyseven cents January. I cant stand my own mind. America when will we end the human war? Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb. I dont feel good dont bother me. I wont write my poem till I'm in my right mind. America when will you be angelic? When will you take off your clothes? When will you look at yourself through the grave? When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites? America why are your libraries full of tears? America when will you send your eggs to India? I'm sick of your insane demands. When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks? America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world. Your machinery is too much for me. You made me want to be a saint. There must be some other way to settle this argument. Burroughs is in Tangiers I dont think hell come back its sinister. Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke? I'm trying to come to the point. I refuse to give up my obsession. America stop pushing I know what I'm doing. America the plum blossoms are falling. I havent read the newspapers for months, everyday somebody goes on trial for murder. America I feel sentimental about the Wobblies. America I used to be a communist when I was a kid I'm not sorry. I smoke marijuana every chance I get. I sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet. When I go to Chinatown I get drunk and never get laid. My mind is made up theres going to be trouble. You should have seen me reading Marx. My psychoanalyst thinks I'm perfectly right. I wont say the Lords Prayer. I have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations. America I still havent told you what you did to Uncle Max after he came over from Russia. I'm addressing you. Are you going to let your emotional life be run by Time Magazine? I'm obsessed by Time Magazine. I read it every week. Its cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore. I read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library. Its always telling me about responsibility. Businessmen are serious. Movie producers are serious. Everybodys serious but me. It occurs to me that I am America. I am talking to myself again. Asia is rising against me. I havent got a chinamans chance. Id better consider my national resources. My national resources consist of two joints of marijuana millions of genitals an unpublishable private literature that jetplanes miles an hour and twentyfive-thousand mental institutions. I say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of underprivileged who live in my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns. I have abolished the whorehouses of France, Tangiers is the next to go. My ambition is to be President despite the fact that I'm a Catholic. America how can I write a holy litany in your silly mood? I will continue like Henry Ford my strophes are as individual as his automobiles more so theyre all different sexes. America I will sell you strophes $ apiece $ down on your old strophe America free Tom Mooney America save the Spanish Loyalists America Sacco and Vanzetti must not die America I am the Scottsboro boys. America when I was seven momma took me to Communist Cell meetings they sold us garbanzos a handful per ticket a ticket costs a nickel and the speeches were free everybody was angelic and sentimental about the workers it was all so sincere you have no idea what a good thing the party was in Scott Nearing was a grand old man a real mensch Mother Bloor the Silk-strikers Ewig-Weibliche made me cry I once saw the Yiddish orator Israel Amter plain. Everybody must have been a spy. America you dont really want to go to war. America its them bad Russians. Them Russians them Russians and them Chinamen. And them Russians. The Russia wants to eat us alive. The Russias power mad. She wants to take our cars from out our garages. Her wants to grab Chicago. Her needs a Red Readers Digest. Her wants our auto plants in Siberia. Him big bureaucracy running our fillingstations. That no good. Ugh. Him make Indians learn read. Him need big black niggers. Hah. Her make us all work sixteen hours a day. Help. America this is quite serious. America this is the impression I get from looking in the television set. America is this correct? Id better get right down to the job. Its true I dont want to join the Army or turn lathes in precision parts factories, I'm nearsighted and psychopathic anyway. America I'm putting my queer shoulder to the wheel. If I were doing my Laundry Id wash my dirty Iran Id throw in my United States, and pour on the Ivory Soap, scrub up Africa, put all the birds and elephants back in the jungle, Id wash the Amazon river and clean the oily Carib and Gulf of Mexico, Rub that smog off the North Pole, wipe up all the pipelines in Alaska, Rub a dub dub for Rocky Flats and Los Alamos, Flush that sparkly Cesium out of Love Canal Rinse down the Acid Rain over the Parthenon and Sphinx, Drain Sludge out of the Mediterranean basin and make it azure again, Put some blueing back into the sky over the Rhine, bleach the little Clouds so snow return white as snow, Cleanse the Hudson Thames and Neckar, Drain the Suds out of Lake ErieThen Id throw big Asia in one giant Load and wash out the blood and Agent Orange, Dump the whole mess of Russia and China in the wringer, squeeze out the tattletail Gray of U. S. Central American police state, and put the planet in the drier and let it sit minutes or an Aeon till it came out clean. Sometimes when my eyes are red I go up on top of the RCA Building and gaze at my world, Manhattan— my buildings, streets Ive done feats in, lofts, beds, coldwater flats —on Fifth Ave below which I also bear in mind, its ant cars, little yellow taxis, men walking the size of specks of wool— Panorama of the bridges, sunrise over Brooklyn machine, sun go down over New Jersey where I was born and Paterson where I played with ants— my later loves on th Street, my greater loves of Lower East Side, my once fabulous amours in the Bronx faraway— paths crossing in these hidden streets, my history summed up, my absences and ecstasies in Harlem— —sun shining down on all I own in one eyeblink to the horizon in my last eternity— matter is water. Sad, I take the elevator and go down, pondering, and walk on the pavements staring into all mans plateglass, faces, questioning after who loves, and stop, bemused in front of an automobile shopwindow standing lost in calm thought, traffic moving up and down th Avenue blocks behind me waiting for a moment when,Time to go home and cook supper and listen to the romantic war news on the radio,all movement stops and I walk in the timeless sadness of existence, tenderness flowing thru the buildings, my fingertips touching realitys face, my own face streaked with tears in the mirror of some window—at dusk— where I have no desire— for bonbons—or to own the dresses or Japanese lampshades of intellection— Confused by the spectacle around me, Man struggling up the street with packages, newspapers, ties, beautiful suits toward his desire Man, woman, streaming over the pavements red lights clocking hurried watches and movements at the curb— And all these streets leading so crosswise, honking, lengthily, by avenues stalked by high buildings or crusted into slums thru such halting traffic screaming cars and engines so painfully to this countryside, this graveyard this stillness on deathbed or mountain once seen never regained or desired in the mind to come where all Manhattan that Ive seen must disappear. I have studied the tight curls on the back of your neck moving away from me beyond anger or failure your face in the evening schools of longing through mornings of wish and ripen we were always saying goodbye in the blood in the bone over coffee before dashing for elevators going in opposite directions without goodbyes. Do not remember me as a bridge nor a roof as the maker of legends nor as a trap door to that world where black and white clericals hang on the edge of beauty in five oclock elevators twitching their shoulders to avoid other flesh and now there is someone to speak for them moving away from me into tomorrows morning of wish and ripen your goodbye is a promise of lightning in the last angels hand unwelcome and warning the sands have run out against us we were rewarded by journeys away from each other into desire into mornings alone where excuse and endurance mingle conceiving decision. Do not remember me as disaster nor as the keeper of secrets I am a fellow rider in the cattle cars watching you move slowly out of my bed saying we cannot waste time only ourselves. I sing the body electric, The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them, They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul. Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves? And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul? And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul? The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account, That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect. The expression of the face balks account, But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him, The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth, To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more, You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side. The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water, The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle, Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting, The female soothing a child, the farmers daughter in the garden or cow-yard, The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd, The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work, The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes; The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curvd neck and the counting; Such-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mothers breast with the little child, Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count. I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons, And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons. This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person, The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners, These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also, He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome, They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him, They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love, He drank water only, the blood showd like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face, He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he saild his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him, When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang, You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other. I have perceivd that to be with those I like is enough, To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough, To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then? I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea. There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well, All things please the soul, but these please the soul well. This is the female form, A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot, It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or feard of hell, are now consumed, Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable, Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused, Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching, Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice, Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn, Undulating into the willing and yielding day, Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-fleshd day. This the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman, This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest, You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. The female contains all qualities and tempers them, She is in her place and moves with perfect balance, She is all things duly veild, she is both passive and active, She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. As I see my soul reflected in Nature, As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty, See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see. The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place, He too is all qualities, he is action and power, The flush of the known universe is in him, Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well, The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him, The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul, Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself, Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here, Where else does he strike soundings except here? The mans body is sacred and the womans body is sacred, No matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers gang? Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf? Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you, Each has his or her place in the procession. All is a procession, The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion. Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant? Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight? Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts, For you only, and not for him and her? A mans body at auction, For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale, I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business. Gentlemen look on this wonder, Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it, For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant, For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily rolld. In this head the all-baffling brain, In it and below it the makings of heroes. Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve, They shall be stript that you may see them. Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs, And wonders within there yet. Within there runs blood, The same old blood! the same red-running blood! There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations, Do you think they are not there because they are not expressd in parlors and lecture-rooms? This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns, In him the start of populous states and rich republics, Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments. How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries? Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries? A womans body at auction, She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers, She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers. Have you ever loved the body of a woman? Have you ever loved the body of a man? Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth? If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred, And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted, And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face. Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body? For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves. O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you, I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul, and that they are the soul, I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and that they are my poems, Mans, womans, childs, youths, wifes, husbands, mothers, fathers, young mans, young womans poems, Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears, Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids, Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges, Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue, Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the chest, Upper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones, Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger, finger-joints, finger-nails, Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side, Ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone, Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root, Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above, Leg fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg, Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel; All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body or of any ones body, male or female, The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean, The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame, Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity, Womanhood, and all that is a woman, and the man that comes from woman, The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and risings, The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud, Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming, Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening, The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes, The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair, The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body, The circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out, The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees, The thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the marrow in the bones, The exquisite realization of health; O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul, O I say now these are the soul! The night we got bashed we told Rusty how they drove up, yelled QUEER, threw a hot dog, sped off. Rusty: Now, is that gaybashing? Or are they just calling you queer? Good point. Josey pitied the fools: who buys a perfectly good pack of wieners and drives around San Francisco chucking them at gays? And who speeds off? Missing the point, the pleasure of the bash? Dear bashers, you should have seen the hot dog hit my neck, the scarf Josey sewed from antique silk kimonos: so gay. You missed laughing at us, us confused, your raw hot dog on the ground. Josey and Rusty and Bob make fun of the gaybashers, and I wash my scarf in the sink. I use Woolite. We worry about insurance, interest rates. Not hot dogs thrown from F-s, homophobic freaks. After the bashing, we used the ATM in the sex shop next to Annie's Social Club, smiled at the kind owner, his handlebar mustache. Astrud Gilberto sang tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema. and the dildos gleamed from the walls, a hundred cheerful colors. In San Francisco it rains hot dogs, pity-the-fool. Ass-sized penguins, cock after cock in azure acrylic, butterscotch glass, anyone's flesh-tone, chrome. We are walking our very public attraction through eighteenth-century Philadelphia. I am simultaneously butch girlfriend and suburban child on a school trip, Independence Hall, home to the Second Continental Congress. Although she is wearing her leather jacket, although we have made love for the first time in a hotel room on Rittenhouse Square, I am preparing my teenage escape from Philadelphia, from Elfreths Alley, the oldest continuously occupied residential street in the nation, from Carpenters Hall, from Congress Hall, from Graff House where the young Thomas Jefferson lived, summer of. In my starched shirt and waistcoat, in my leggings and buckled shoes, in postmodern drag, as a young eighteenth-century statesman, I am seventeen and tired of fighting for freedom and the rights of men. I am already dreaming of Boston— city of women, demonstrations, and revolution on a grand and personal scale. Then the maître d is pulling out our chairs for brunch, we have the surprised look of people who have been kissing and now find themselves dressed and dining in a Locust Street townhouse turned café, who do not know one another very well, who continue with optimism to pursue relationship. Eternity may simply be our mortal default mechanism set on hope despite all evidence. In this mood, I roll up my shirtsleeves and she touches my elbow. I refuse the seedy view from the hotel window. I picture instead their silver inkstands, the hoopskirt factory on Arch Street, the Wireworks, their eighteenth-century herb gardens, their nineteenth-century row houses restored with period door knockers. Step outside. We have been deeded the largest landscaped space within a city anywhere in the world. In Fairmount Park, on horseback, among the ancient ginkgoes, oaks, persimmons, and magnolias, we are seventeen and imperishable, cutting classes May of our senior year. And I am happy as the young Tom Jefferson, unbuttoning my collar, imagining his power, considering my healthy body, how I might use it in the service of the country of my pleasure. Even tonight and I need to take a walk and clear my head about this poem about why I cant go out without changing my clothes my shoes my body posture my gender identity my age my status as a woman alone in the evening/ alone on the streets/alone not being the point/ the point being that I cant do what I want to do with my own body because I am the wrong sex the wrong age the wrong skin and suppose it was not here in the city but down on the beach/ or far into the woods and I wanted to go there by myself thinking about God/or thinking about children or thinking about the world/all of it disclosed by the stars and the silence: I could not go and I could not think and I could not stay there alone as I need to be alone because I cant do what I want to do with my own body and who in the hell set things up like this and in France they say if the guy penetrates but does not ejaculate then he did not rape me and if after stabbing him if after screams if after begging the bastard and if even after smashing a hammer to his head if even after that if he and his buddies fuck me after that then I consented and there was no rape because finally you understand finally they fucked me over because I was wrong I was wrong again to be me being me where I was/wrong to be who I am which is exactly like South Africa penetrating into Namibia penetrating into Angola and does that mean I mean how do you know if Pretoria ejaculates what will the evidence look like the proof of the monster jackboot ejaculation on Blackland and if after Namibia and if after Angola and if after Zimbabwe and if after all of my kinsmen and women resist even to self-immolation of the villages and if after that we lose nevertheless what will the big boys say will they claim my consent: Do You Follow Me: We are the wrong people of the wrong skin on the wrong continent and what in the hell is everybody being reasonable about and according to the Times this week back in the C. I. A. decided that they had this problem and the problem was a man named Nkrumah so they killed him and before that it was Patrice Lumumba and before that it was my father on the campus of my Ivy League school and my father afraid to walk into the cafeteria because he said he was wrong the wrong age the wrong skin the wrong gender identity and he was paying my tuition and before that it was my father saying I was wrong saying that I should have been a boy because he wanted one/a boy and that I should have been lighter skinned and that I should have had straighter hair and that I should not be so boy crazy but instead I should just be one/a boy and before that it was my mother pleading plastic surgery for my nose and braces for my teeth and telling me to let the books loose to let them loose in other words I am very familiar with the problems of the C. I. A. and the problems of South Africa and the problems of Exxon Corporation and the problems of white America in general and the problems of the teachers and the preachers and the F. B. I. and the social workers and my particular Mom and Dad/I am very familiar with the problems because the problems turn out to be me I am the history of rape I am the history of the rejection of who I am I am the history of the terrorized incarceration of myself I am the history of battery assault and limitless armies against whatever I want to do with my mind and my body and my soul and whether its about walking out at night or whether its about the love that I feel or whether its about the sanctity of my vagina or the sanctity of my national boundaries or the sanctity of my leaders or the sanctity of each and every desire that I know from my personal and idiosyncratic and indisputably single and singular heart I have been raped be- cause I have been wrong the wrong sex the wrong age the wrong skin the wrong nose the wrong hair the wrong need the wrong dream the wrong geographic the wrong sartorial I I have been the meaning of rape I have been the problem everyone seeks to eliminate by forced penetration with or without the evidence of slime and/ but let this be unmistakable this poem is not consent I do not consent to my mother to my father to the teachers to the F. B. I. to South Africa to Bedford-Stuy to Park Avenue to American Airlines to the hardon idlers on the corners to the sneaky creeps in cars I am not wrong: Wrong is not my name My name is my own my own my own and I cant tell you who the hell set things up like this but I can tell you that from now on my resistance my simple and daily and nightly self-determination may very well cost you your life Argonne Place, NW Alley of giant air conditioners, you roared your ill wind our way day and night. We burned you down, little house, but you rose right up again. We played guitars by candlelight and sang songs to the cat. We stole each others cake and dope, dancing all night, sleeping late, driving down Columbia Road to the Omega for Mexican-style chicken, which two lovers could live on for an entire day. We threatened you with a sledgehammer if you wouldnt let us go. Enough, you finally stammered, be gone from Argonne! St. NW: The Chateau Thierry If you opened the door without thinking, the entire neighborhood gushed into the apartment like an open hydrant. We gathered around the black and white tv like it was a tabernacle containing the secrets we yearned to know. The first Gay Pride Day made the building tremble so violently the roaches scurried from the cracks and crevices looking for safer quarters. Theodore, Edward, and Al ran the only manual elevator still going in our part of town. Casey, violent and crazy, dealt coke out of his first floor apartment. Mara owned a dozen petite dogs to be avoided at all costs. Zoltan Farkas wrote The Baltimore Poems and disappeared completely from the landscape. I had a brass bed, my altar of love, and a cat named Spooky. People yelled my name up the side of the building, I threw them a key out the window, and they rose up to the fifth floor and through that open door into my abode of bliss, which I still miss. Massachusetts Ave. NW: Cathedral Court They told me I was moving to the geriatric district. No Metro up there, they warned. But I was now on top of the hill, across the street from one of Gods most prestigious addresses. I would stare at the naked bodies carved above the Cathedral entrance, like a page torn from the Playboy version of Genesis, thinking yes—this is the way religion should be. A bus took me back to Dupont Circle in three minutes. At night Id walk home up Mass Ave, past all the embassies, loving to touch down momentarily on Irish soil, salute the statue of Gibran, great poet of wedding-vow love, hail Mary and Tom and Cyn and Steve. Pick up the mail. Waltz with Susan in the enormous living room, then lie in bed at night, by the window, hypnotized by the big cake of a church bathed in its rosy blush of light, fireworks erupting somewhere in the citys distant dark. Strong Son of God, immortal Love, Whom we, that have not seen thy face, By faith, and faith alone, embrace, Believing where we cannot prove;Thine are these orbs of light and shade; Thou madest Life in man and brute; Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot Is on the skull which thou hast made. Thou wilt not leave us in the dust: Thou madest man, he knows not why, He thinks he was not made to die; And thou hast made him: thou art just. Thou seemest human and divine, The highest, holiest manhood, thou. Our wills are ours, we know not how; Our wills are ours, to make them thine. Our little systems have their day; They have their day and cease to be: They are but broken lights of thee, And thou, O Lord, art more than they. We have but faith: we cannot know; For knowledge is of things we see And yet we trust it comes from thee, A beam in darkness: let it grow. Let knowledge grow from more to more, But more of reverence in us dwell; That mind and soul, according well, May make one music as before, But vaster. We are fools and slight; We mock thee when we do not fear: But help thy foolish ones to bear; Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light. Forgive what seem'd my sin in me; What seem'd my worth since I began; For merit lives from man to man, And not from man, O Lord, to thee. Forgive my grief for one removed, Thy creature, whom I found so fair. I trust he lives in thee, and there I find him worthier to be loved. Forgive these wild and wandering cries, Confusions of a wasted youth; Forgive them where they fail in truth, And in thy wisdom make me wise. I I held it truth, with him who sings To one clear harp in divers tones, That men may rise on stepping-stones Of their dead selves to higher things. But who shall so forecast the years And find in loss a gain to match? Or reach a hand thro' time to catch The far-off interest of tears?Let Love clasp Grief lest both be drown'd, Let darkness keep her raven gloss: Ah, sweeter to be drunk with loss, To dance with death, to beat the ground, Than that the victor Hours should scorn The long result of love, and boast, Behold the man that loved and lost, But all he was is overworn.II Old Yew, which graspest at the stones That name the under-lying dead, Thy fibres net the dreamless head, Thy roots are wrapt about the bones. The seasons bring the flower again, And bring the firstling to the flock; And in the dusk of thee, the clock Beats out the little lives of men. O, not for thee the glow, the bloom, Who changest not in any gale, Nor branding summer suns avail To touch thy thousand years of gloom:And gazing on thee, sullen tree, Sick for thy stubborn hardihood, I seem to fail from out my blood And grow incorporate into thee. III O Sorrow, cruel fellowship, O Priestess in the vaults of Death, O sweet and bitter in a breath, What whispers from thy lying lip?'The stars, she whispers, blindly run; A web is wov'n across the sky; From out waste places comes a cry, And murmurs from the dying sun:'And all the phantom, Nature, stands— With all the music in her tone, A hollow echo of my own, A hollow form with empty hands.And shall I take a thing so blind, Embrace her as my natural good; Or crush her, like a vice of blood, Upon the threshold of the mind?IV To Sleep I give my powers away; My will is bondsman to the dark; I sit within a helmless bark, And with my heart I muse and say:O heart, how fares it with thee now, That thou should'st fail from thy desire, Who scarcely darest to inquire, 'What is it makes me beat so low?'Something it is which thou hast lost, Some pleasure from thine early years. Break, thou deep vase of chilling tears, That grief hath shaken into frost!Such clouds of nameless trouble cross All night below the darken'd eyes; With morning wakes the will, and cries, 'Thou shalt not be the fool of loss.V I sometimes hold it half a sin To put in words the grief I feel; For words, like Nature, half reveal And half conceal the Soul within. But, for the unquiet heart and brain, A use in measured language lies; The sad mechanic exercise, Like dull narcotics, numbing pain. In words, like weeds, I'll wrap me o'er, Like coarsest clothes against the cold: But that large grief which these enfold Is given in outline and no more. VI One writes, that Other friends remain, That Loss is common to the race'— And common is the commonplace, And vacant chaff well meant for grain. That loss is common would not make My own less bitter, rather more: Too common! Never morning wore To evening, but some heart did break. O father, wheresoe'er thou be, Who pledgest now thy gallant son; A shot, ere half thy draught be done, Hath still'd the life that beat from thee. O mother, praying God will save Thy sailor, while thy head is bow'd, His heavy-shotted hammock-shroud Drops in his vast and wandering grave. Ye know no more than I who wrought At that last hour to please him well; Who mused on all I had to tell, And something written, something thought;Expecting still his advent home; And ever met him on his way With wishes, thinking, here to-day, Or here to-morrow will he come.O somewhere, meek, unconscious dove, That sittest ranging golden hair; And glad to find thyself so fair, Poor child, that waitest for thy love!For now her father's chimney glows In expectation of a guest; And thinking this will please him best, She takes a riband or a rose;For he will see them on to-night; And with the thought her colour burns; And, having left the glass, she turns Once more to set a ringlet right; And, even when she turn'd, the curse Had fallen, and her future Lord Was drown'd in passing thro' the ford, Or kill'd in falling from his horse. O what to her shall be the end? And what to me remains of good? To her, perpetual maidenhood, And unto me no second friend. VII Dark house, by which once more I stand Here in the long unlovely street, Doors, where my heart was used to beat So quickly, waiting for a hand, A hand that can be clasp'd no more— Behold me, for I cannot sleep, And like a guilty thing I creep At earliest morning to the door. He is not here; but far away The noise of life begins again, And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain On the bald street breaks the blank day. VIII A happy lover who has come To look on her that loves him well, Who 'lights and rings the gateway bell, And learns her gone and far from home;He saddens, all the magic light Dies off at once from bower and hall, And all the place is dark, and all The chambers emptied of delight:So find I every pleasant spot In which we two were wont to meet, The field, the chamber, and the street, For all is dark where thou art not. Yet as that other, wandering there In those deserted walks, may find A flower beat with rain and wind, Which once she foster'd up with care;So seems it in my deep regret, O my forsaken heart, with thee And this poor flower of poesy Which little cared for fades not yet. But since it pleased a vanish'd eye, I go to plant it on his tomb, That if it can it there may bloom, Or, dying, there at least may die. IX Fair ship, that from the Italian shore Sailest the placid ocean-plains With my lost Arthur's loved remains, Spread thy full wings, and waft him o'er. So draw him home to those that mourn In vain; a favourable speed Ruffle thy mirror'd mast, and lead Thro' prosperous floods his holy urn. All night no ruder air perplex Thy sliding keel, till Phosphor, bright As our pure love, thro' early light Shall glimmer on the dewy decks. Sphere all your lights around, above; Sleep, gentle heavens, before the prow; Sleep, gentle winds, as he sleeps now, My friend, the brother of my love;My Arthur, whom I shall not see Till all my widow'd race be run; Dear as the mother to the son, More than my brothers are to me. X I hear the noise about thy keel; I hear the bell struck in the night: I see the cabin-window bright; I see the sailor at the wheel. Thou bring'st the sailor to his wife, And travell'd men from foreign lands; And letters unto trembling hands; And, thy dark freight, a vanish'd life. So bring him; we have idle dreams: This look of quiet flatters thus Our home-bred fancies. O to us, The fools of habit, sweeter seemsTo rest beneath the clover sod, That takes the sunshine and the rains, Or where the kneeling hamlet drains The chalice of the grapes of God;Than if with thee the roaring wells Should gulf him fathom-deep in brine; And hands so often clasp'd in mine, Should toss with tangle and with shells. XI Calm is the morn without a sound, Calm as to suit a calmer grief, And only thro' the faded leaf The chestnut pattering to the ground:Calm and deep peace on this high world, And on these dews that drench the furze, And all the silvery gossamers That twinkle into green and gold:Calm and still light on yon great plain That sweeps with all its autumn bowers, And crowded farms and lessening towers, To mingle with the bounding main:Calm and deep peace in this wide air, These leaves that redden to the fall; And in my heart, if calm at all, If any calm, a calm despair:Calm on the seas, and silver sleep, And waves that sway themselves in rest, And dead calm in that noble breast Which heaves but with the heaving deep. XII Lo, as a dove when up she springs To bear thro' Heaven a tale of woe, Some dolorous message knit below The wild pulsation of her wings;Like her I go; I cannot stay; I leave this mortal ark behind, A weight of nerves without a mind, And leave the cliffs, and haste awayO'er ocean-mirrors rounded large, And reach the glow of southern skies, And see the sails at distance rise, And linger weeping on the marge, And saying; Comes he thus, my friend? Is this the end of all my care?' And circle moaning in the air: 'Is this the end? Is this the end?'And forward dart again, and play About the prow, and back return To where the body sits, and learn That I have been an hour away. XIII Tears of the widower, when he sees A late-lost form that sleep reveals, And moves his doubtful arms, and feels Her place is empty, fall like these;Which weep a loss for ever new, A void where heart on heart reposed; And, where warm hands have prest and closed, Silence, till I be silent too. Which weep the comrade of my choice, An awful thought, a life removed, The human-hearted man I loved, A Spirit, not a breathing voice. Come, Time, and teach me, many years, I do not suffer in a dream; For now so strange do these things seem, Mine eyes have leisure for their tears;My fancies time to rise on wing, And glance about the approaching sails, As tho' they brought but merchants' bales, And not the burthen that they bring. XIV If one should bring me this report, That thou hadst touch'd the land to-day, And I went down unto the quay, And found thee lying in the portAnd standing, muffled round with woe, Should see thy passengers in rank Come stepping lightly down the plank, And beckoning unto those they knowAnd if along with these should come The man I held as half-divine; Should strike a sudden hand in mine, And ask a thousand things of homeAnd I should tell him all my pain, And how my life had droop'd of late, And he should sorrow o'er my state And marvel what possess'd my brainAnd I perceived no touch of change, No hint of death in all his frame, But found him all in all the same, I should not feel it to be strange. XV To-night the winds begin to rise And roar from yonder dropping day: The last red leaf is whirl'd away, The rooks are blown about the skies;The forest crack'd, the waters curl'd, The cattle huddled on the lea; And wildly dash'd on tower and tree The sunbeam strikes along the world:And but for fancies, which aver That all thy motions gently pass Athwart a plane of molten glass, I scarce could brook the strain and stirThat makes the barren branches loud; And but for fear it is not so, The wild unrest that lives in woe Would dote and pore on yonder cloudThat rises upward always higher, And onward drags a labouring breast, And topples round the dreary west, A looming bastion fringed with fire. XVI What words are these have falle'n from me? Can calm despair and wild unrest Be tenants of a single breast, Or sorrow such a changeling be? Or cloth she only seem to take The touch of change in calm or storm; But knows no more of transient form In her deep self, than some dead lakeThat holds the shadow of a lark Hung in the shadow of a heaven? Or has the shock, so harshly given, Confused me like the unhappy barkThat strikes by night a craggy shelf, And staggers blindly ere she sink? And stunn'd me from my power to think And all my knowledge of myselfAnd made me that delirious man Whose fancy fuses old and new, And flashes into false and true, And mingles all without a plan?XVII Thou comest, much wept for: such a breeze Compell'd thy canvas, and my prayer Was as the whisper of an air To breathe thee over lonely seas. For I in spirit saw thee move Thro' circles of the bounding sky, Week after week: the days go by: Come quick, thou bringest all I love. Henceforth, wherever thou may'st roam, My blessing, like a line of light, Is on the waters day and night, And like a beacon guards thee home. So may whatever tempest mars Mid-ocean, spare thee, sacred bark; And balmy drops in summer dark Slide from the bosom of the stars. So kind an office hath been done, Such precious relics brought by thee; The dust of him I shall not see Till all my widow'd race be run. XVIII 'Tis well; 'tis something; we may stand Where he in English earth is laid, And from his ashes may be made The violet of his native land.Tis little; but it looks in truth As if the quiet bones were blest Among familiar names to rest And in the places of his youth. Come then, pure hands, and bear the head That sleeps or wears the mask of sleep, And come, whatever loves to weep, And hear the ritual of the dead. Ah yet, ev'n yet, if this might be, I, falling on his faithful heart, Would breathing thro' his lips impart The life that almost dies in me;That dies not, but endures with pain, And slowly forms the firmer mind, Treasuring the look it cannot find, The words that are not heard again. XIX The Danube to the Severn gave The darken'd heart that beat no more; They laid him by the pleasant shore, And in the hearing of the wave. There twice a day the Severn fills; The salt sea-water passes by, And hushes half the babbling Wye, And makes a silence in the hills. The Wye is hush'd nor moved along, And hush'd my deepest grief of all, When fill'd with tears that cannot fall, I brim with sorrow drowning song. The tide flows down, the wave again Is vocal in its wooded walls; My deeper anguish also falls, And I can speak a little then. XX The lesser griefs that may be said, That breathe a thousand tender vows, Are but as servants in a house Where lies the master newly dead;Who speak their feeling as it is, And weep the fulness from the mind: It will be hard, they say, to find Another service such as this.My lighter moods are like to these, That out of words a comfort win; But there are other griefs within, And tears that at their fountain freeze;For by the hearth the children sit Cold in that atmosphere of Death, And scarce endure to draw the breath, Or like to noiseless phantoms flit; But open converse is there none, So much the vital spirits sink To see the vacant chair, and think, 'How good! how kind! and he is gone.XXI I sing to him that rests below, And, since the grasses round me wave, I take the grasses of the grave, And make them pipes whereon to blow. The traveller hears me now and then, And sometimes harshly will he speak: This fellow would make weakness weak, And melt the waxen hearts of men.Another answers, Let him be, He loves to make parade of pain That with his piping he may gain The praise that comes to constancy.A third is wroth: Is this an hour For private sorrow's barren song, When more and more the people throng The chairs and thrones of civil power?'A time to sicken and to swoon, When Science reaches forth her arms To feel from world to world, and charms Her secret from the latest moon?'Behold, ye speak an idle thing: Ye never knew the sacred dust: I do but sing because I must, And pipe but as the linnets sing:And one is glad; her note is gay, For now her little ones have ranged; And one is sad; her note is changed, Because her brood is stol'n away. XXII The path by which we twain did go, Which led by tracts that pleased us well, Thro' four sweet years arose and fell, From flower to flower, from snow to snow:And we with singing cheer'd the way, And, crown'd with all the season lent, From April on to April went, And glad at heart from May to May:But where the path we walk'd began To slant the fifth autumnal slope, As we descended following Hope, There sat the Shadow fear'd of man;Who broke our fair companionship, And spread his mantle dark and cold, And wrapt thee formless in the fold, And dull'd the murmur on thy lip, And bore thee where I could not see Nor follow, tho' I walk in haste, And think, that somewhere in the waste The Shadow sits and waits for me. XXIII Now, sometimes in my sorrow shut, Or breaking into song by fits, Alone, alone, to where he sits, The Shadow cloak'd from head to foot, Who keeps the keys of all the creeds, I wander, often falling lame, And looking back to whence I came, Or on to where the pathway leadsAnd crying, How changed from where it ran Thro' lands where not a leaf was dumb; But all the lavish hills would hum The murmur of a happy Pan:When each by turns was guide to each, And Fancy light from Fancy caught, And Thought leapt out to wed with Thought Ere Thought could wed itself with SpeechAnd all we met was fair and good, And all was good that Time could bring, And all the secret of the Spring Moved in the chambers of the bloodAnd many an old philosophy On Argive heights divinely sang, And round us all the thicket rang To many a flute of Arcady. XXIV And was the day of my delight As pure and perfect as I say? The very source and fount of Day Is dash'd with wandering isles of night. If all was good and fair we met, This earth had been the Paradise It never look'd to human eyes Since our first Sun arose and set. And is it that the haze of grief Makes former gladness loom so great? The lowness of the present state, That sets the past in this relief?Or that the past will always win A glory from its being far; And orb into the perfect star We saw not, when we moved therein?XXV I know that this was Life, the track Whereon with equal feet we fared; And then, as now, the day prepared The daily burden for the back. But this it was that made me move As light as carrier-birds in air; I loved the weight I had to bear, Because it needed help of Love:Nor could I weary, heart or limb, When mighty Love would cleave in twain The lading of a single pain, And part it, giving half to him. XXVI Still onward winds the dreary way; I with it; for I long to prove No lapse of moons can canker Love, Whatever fickle tongues may say. And if that eye which watches guilt And goodness, and hath power to see Within the green the moulder'd tree, And towers fall'n as soon as built—Oh, if indeed that eye foresee Or see in Him is no before In more of life true life no more And Love the indifference to be, Then might I find, ere yet the morn Breaks hither over Indian seas, That Shadow waiting with the keys, To shroud me from my proper scorn. XXVII I envy not in any moods The captive void of noble rage, The linnet born within the cage, That never knew the summer woods:I envy not the beast that takes His license in the field of time, Unfetter'd by the sense of crime, To whom a conscience never wakes;Nor, what may count itself as blest, The heart that never plighted troth But stagnates in the weeds of sloth; Nor any want-begotten rest. I hold it true, whate'er befall; I feel it, when I sorrow most; 'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all. `
const mennwomen = `Of writing many books there is no end; And I who have written much in prose and verse For others uses, will write now for mine, Will write my story for my better self, As when you paint your portrait for a friend, Who keeps it in a drawer and looks at it Long after he has ceased to love you, just To hold together what he was and is. I, writing thus, am still what men call young; I have not so far left the coasts of life To travel inland, that I cannot hear That murmur of the outer Infinite Which unweaned babies smile at in their sleep When wondered at for smiling; not so far, But still I catch my mother at her post Beside the nursery-door, with finger up, Hush, hush—heres too much noise! while her sweet eyes Leap forward, taking part against her word In the childs riot. Still I sit and feel My fathers slow hand, when she had left us both, Stroke out my childish curls across his knee; And hear Assuntas daily jest she knew He liked it better than a better jest Inquire how many golden scudi went To make such ringlets. O my fathers hand, Stroke the poor hair down, stroke it heavily, Draw, press the childs head closer to thy knee! I'm still too young, too young, to sit alone. I write. My mother was a Florentine, Whose rare blue eyes were shut from seeing me When scarcely I was four years old; my life, A poor spark snatched up from a failing lamp Which went out therefore. She was weak and frail; She could not bear the joy of giving life— The mothers rapture slew her. If her kiss Had left a longer weight upon my lips, It might have steadied the uneasy breath, And reconciled and fraternised my soul With the new order. As it was, indeed, I felt a mother-want about the world, And still went seeking, like a bleating lamb Left out at night, in shutting up the fold, As restless as a nest-deserted bird Grown chill through something being away, though what It knows not. I, Aurora Leigh, was born To make my father sadder, and myself Not overjoyous, truly. Women know The way to rear up children, to be just, They know a simple, merry, tender knack Of tying sashes, fitting baby-shoes, And stringing pretty words that make no sense, And kissing full sense into empty words; Which things are corals to cut life upon, Although such trifles: children learn by such, Loves holy earnest in a pretty play, And get not over-early solemnised, But seeing, as in a rose-bush, Loves Divine, Which burns and hurts not, not a single bloom, Become aware and unafraid of Love. Such good do mothers. Fathers love as well —Mine did, I know, but still with heavier brains, And wills more consciously responsible, And not as wisely, since less foolishly; So mothers have Gods licence to be missed. My father was an austere Englishman, Who, after a dry life-time spent at home In college-learning, law, and parish talk, Was flooded with a passion unaware, His whole provisioned and complacent past Drowned out from him that moment. As he stood In Florence, where he had come to spend a month And note the secret of Da Vincis drains, He musing somewhat absently perhaps Some English question,whether men should pay The unpopular but necessary tax With left or right hand—in the alien sun In that great square of the Santissima, There drifted past him scarcely marked enough To move his comfortable island-scorn, A train of priestly banners, cross and psalm, The white-veiled rose-crowned maidens holding up Tall tapers, weighty for such wrists, aslant To the blue luminous tremor of the air, And letting drop the white wax as they went To eat the bishops wafer at the church; From which long trail of chanting priests and girls, A face flashed like a cymbal on his face, And shook with silent clangour brain and heart, Transfiguring him to music. Thus, even thus, He too received his sacramental gift With eucharistic meanings; for he loved. And thus beloved, she died. Ive heard it said That but to see him in the first surprise Of widower and father, nursing me, Unmothered little child of four years old, His large mans hands afraid to touch my curls, As if the gold would tarnish, his grave lips Contriving such a miserable smile, As if he knew needs must, or I should die, And yet twas hard, would almost make the stones Cry out for pity. Theres a verse he set In Santa Croce to her memory, Weep for an infant too young to weep much When death removed this mother—stops the mirth To-day, on womens faces when they walk With rosy children hanging on their gowns, Under the cloister, to escape the sun That scorches in the piazza. After which, He left our Florence, and made haste to hide Himself, his prattling child, and silent grief, Among the mountains above Pelago; Because unmothered babes, he thought, had need Of mother nature more than others use, And Pans white goats, with udders warm and full Of mystic contemplations, come to feed Poor milkless lips of orphans like his own— Such scholar-scraps he talked, Ive heard from friends, For even prosaic men, who wear grief long, Will get to wear it as a hat aside With a flower stuck int. Father, then, and child, We lived among the mountains many years, Gods silence on the outside of the house, And we, who did not speak too loud, within; And old Assunta to make up the fire, Crossing herself wheneer a sudden flame Which lightened from the firewood, made alive That picture of my mother on the wall. The painter drew it after she was dead; And when the face was finished, throat and hands, Her cameriera carried him, in hate Of the English-fashioned shroud, the last brocade She dressed in at the Pitti. He should paint No sadder thing than that, she swore, to wrong Her poor signora. Therefore very strange The effect was. I, a little child, would crouch For hours upon the floor, with knees drawn up, And gaze across them, half in terror, half In adoration, at the picture there, That swan-like supernatural white life, Just sailing upward from the red stiff silk Which seemed to have no part in it, nor power To keep it from quite breaking out of bounds: For hours I sate and stared. Assuntas awe And my poor fathers melancholy eyes Still pointed that way. That way, went my thoughts When wandering beyond sight. And as I grew In years, I mixed, confused, unconsciously, Whatever I last read or heard or dreamed, Abhorrent, admirable, beautiful, Pathetical, or ghastly, or grotesque, With still that face,which did not therefore change, But kept the mystic level of all forms And fears and admirations; was by turns Ghost, fiend, and angel, fairy, witch, and sprite, A dauntless Muse who eyes a dreadful Fate, A loving Psyche who loses sight of Love, A still Medusa, with mild milky brows All curdled and all clothed upon with snakes Whose slime falls fast as sweat will; or, anon, Our Lady of the Passion, stabbed with swords Where the Babe sucked; or, Lamia in her first Moonlighted pallor, ere she shrunk and blinked, And, shuddering, wriggled down to the unclean; Or, my own mother, leaving her last smile In her last kiss, upon the baby-mouth My father pushed down on the bed for that, Or my dead mother, without smile or kiss, Buried at Florence. All which images, Concentred on the picture, glassed themselves Before my meditative childhood,as The incoherencies of change and death Are represented fully, mixed and merged, In the smooth fair mystery of perpetual Life. And while I stared away my childish wits Upon my mothers picture, ah, poor child! My father, who through love had suddenly Thrown off the old conventions, broken loose From chin-bands of the soul, like Lazarus, Yet had no time to learn to talk and walk Or grow anew familiar with the sun, Who had reached to freedom, not to action, lived, But lived as one entranced, with thoughts, not aims, Whom love had unmade from a common man But not completed to an uncommon man, My father taught me what he had learnt the best Before he died and left me, grief and love. And, seeing we had books among the hills, Strong words of counselling souls, confederate With vocal pines and waters, out of books He taught me all the ignorance of men, And how God laughs in heaven when any man Says Here I'm learned; this, I understand; In that, I am never caught at fault or doubt. He sent the schools to school, demonstrating A fool will pass for such through one mistake, While a philosopher will pass for such, Through said mistakes being ventured in the gross And heaped up to a system. I am like, They tell me, my dear father. Broader brows Howbeit, upon a slenderer undergrowth Of delicate features, paler, near as grave; But then my mothers smile breaks up the whole, And makes it better sometimes than itself. So, nine full years, our days were hid with God Among his mountains. I was just thirteen, Still growing like the plants from unseen roots In tongue-tied Springs, and suddenly awoke To full life and its needs and agonies, With an intense, strong, struggling heart beside A stone-dead father. Life, struck sharp on death, Makes awful lightning. His last word was, Love— Love, my child, love, love!—then he had done with grief Love, my child. Ere I answered he was gone, And none was left to love in all the world. There, ended childhood: what succeeded next I recollect as, after fevers, men Thread back the passage of delirium, Missing the turn still, baffled by the door; Smooth endless days, notched here and there with knives; A weary, wormy darkness, spurred i the flank With flame, that it should eat and end itself Like some tormented scorpion. Then, at last, I do remember clearly, how there came A stranger with authority, not right, I thought not who commanded, caught me up From old Assuntas neck; how, with a shriek, She let me go, while I, with ears too full Of my fathers silence, to shriek back a word, In all a childs astonishment at grief Stared at the wharfage where she stood and moaned, My poor Assunta, where she stood and moaned! The white walls, the blue hills, my Italy, Drawn backward from the shuddering steamer-deck, Like one in anger drawing back her skirts Which suppliants catch at. Then the bitter sea Inexorably pushed between us both, And sweeping up the ship with my despair Threw us out as a pasture to the stars. Ten nights and days we voyaged on the deep; Ten nights and days, without the common face Of any day or night; the moon and sun Cut off from the green reconciling earth, To starve into a blind ferocity And glare unnatural; the very sky Dropping its bell-net down upon the sea As if no human heart should scape alive, Bedraggled with the desolating salt, Until it seemed no more that holy heaven To which my father went. All new, and strange— The universe turned stranger, for a child. Then, land!—then, England! oh, the frosty cliffs Looked cold upon me. Could I find a home Among those mean red houses through the fog? And when I heard my fathers language first From alien lips which had no kiss for mine, I wept aloud, then laughed, then wept, then wept, And some one near me said the child was mad Through much sea-sickness. The train swept us on. Was this my fathers England? the great isle? The ground seemed cut up from the fellowship Of verdure, field from field, as man from man; The skies themselves looked low and positive, As almost you could touch them with a hand, And dared to do it, they were so far off From Gods celestial crystals; all things, blurred And dull and vague. Did Shakspeare and his mates Absorb the light here?—not a hill or stone With heart to strike a radiant colour up Or active outline on the indifferent air! I think I see my fathers sister stand Upon the hall-step of her country-house To give me welcome. She stood straight and calm, Her somewhat narrow forehead braided tight As if for taming accidental thoughts From possible pulses; brown hair pricked with grey By frigid use of life, she was not old, Although my fathers elder by a year A nose drawn sharply, yet in delicate lines; A close mild mouth, a little soured about The ends, through speaking unrequited loves, Or peradventure niggardly half-truths; Eyes of no colour, once they might have smiled, But never, never have forgot themselves In smiling; cheeks, in which was yet a rose Of perished summers, like a rose in a book, Kept more for ruth than pleasure, if past bloom, Past fading also. She had lived, well say, A harmless life, she called a virtuous life, A quiet life, which was not life at all, But that, she had not lived enough to know Between the vicar and the county squires, The lord-lieutenant looking down sometimes From the empyreal, to assure their souls Against chance-vulgarisms, and, in the abyss, The apothecary looked on once a year, To prove their soundness of humility. The poor-club exercised her Christian gifts Of knitting stockings, stitching petticoats, Because we are of one flesh after all And need one flannel, with a proper sense Of difference in the quality—and still The book-club, guarded from your modern trick Of shaking dangerous questions from the crease, Preserved her intellectual. She had lived A sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage, Accounting that to leap from perch to perch Was act and joy enough for any bird. Dear heaven, how silly are the things that live In thickets, and eat berries! I, alas, A wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage, And she was there to meet me. Very kind. Bring the clean water; give out the fresh seed. She stood upon the steps to welcome me, Calm, in black garb. I clung about her neck, Young babes, who catch at every shred of wool To draw the new light closer, catch and cling Less blindly. In my ears, my fathers word Hummed ignorantly, as the sea in shells, Love, love, my child. She, black there with my grief, Might feel my love—she was his sister once— I clung to her. A moment, she seemed moved, Kissed me with cold lips, suffered me to cling, And drew me feebly through the hall, into The room she sate in. There, with some strange spasm Of pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands Imperiously, and held me at arms length, And with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes Searched through my face, ay, stabbed it through and through, Through brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find A wicked murderer in my innocent face, If not here, there perhaps. Then, drawing breath, She struggled for her ordinary calm, And missed it rather, told me not to shrink, As if she had told me not to lie or swear, She loved my father, and would love me too As long as I deserved it. Very kind. I understood her meaning afterward; She thought to find my mother in my face, And questioned it for that. For she, my aunt, Had loved my father truly, as she could, And hated, with the gall of gentle souls, My Tuscan mother, who had fooled away A wise man from wise courses, a good man From obvious duties, and, depriving her, His sister, of the household precedence, Had wronged his tenants, robbed his native land, And made him mad, alike by life and death, In love and sorrow. She had pored for years What sort of woman could be suitable To her sort of hate, to entertain it with; And so, her very curiosity Became hate too, and all the idealism She ever used in life, was used for hate, Till hate, so nourished, did exceed at last The love from which it grew, in strength and heat, And wrinkled her smooth conscience with a sense Of disputable virtue say not, sin When Christian doctrine was enforced at church. And thus my fathers sister was to me My mothers hater. From that day, she did Her duty to me, I appreciate it In her own word as spoken to herself Her duty, in large measure, well-pressed out, But measured always. She was generous, bland, More courteous than was tender, gave me still The first place, as if fearful that Gods saints Would look down suddenly and say, Herein You missed a point, I think, through lack of love. Alas, a mother never is afraid Of speaking angerly to any child, Since love, she knows, is justified of love. And I, I was a good child on the whole, A meek and manageable child. Why not? I did not live, to have the faults of life: There seemed more true life in my fathers grave Than in all England. Since that threw me off Who fain would cleave, his latest will, they say, Consigned me to his land I only thought Of lying quiet there where I was thrown Like sea-weed on the rocks, and suffer her To prick me to a pattern with her pin, Fibre from fibre, delicate leaf from leaf, And dry out from my drowned anatomy The last sea-salt left in me. So it was. I broke the copious curls upon my head In braids, because she liked smooth-ordered hair. I left off saying my sweet Tuscan words Which still at any stirring of the heart Came up to float across the English phrase, As lilies, Bene,or che chè because She liked my fathers child to speak his tongue. I learnt the collects and the catechism, The creeds, from Athanasius back to Nice, The Articles,the Tracts against the times, By no means Buonaventures Prick of Love, And various popular synopses of Inhuman doctrines never taught by John, Because she liked instructed piety. I learnt my complement of classic French Kept pure of Balzac and neologism, And German also, since she liked a range Of liberal education, tongues, not books. I learnt a little algebra, a little Of the mathematics, brushed with extreme flounce The circle of the sciences, because She misliked women who are frivolous. I learnt the royal genealogies Of Oviedo, the internal laws Of the Burmese empire,by how many feet Mount Chimborazo outsoars Himmeleh, What navigable river joins itself To Lara, and what census of the year five Was taken at Klagenfurt, because she liked A general insight into useful facts. I learnt much music, such as would have been As quite impossible in Johnsons day As still it might be wished—fine sleights of hand And unimagined fingering, shuffling off The hearers soul through hurricanes of notes To a noisy Tophet; and I drew,costumes From French engravings, nereids neatly draped, With smirks of simmering godship, I washed in From nature, landscapes, rather say, washed out. I danced the polka and Cellarius, Spun glass, stuffed birds, and modelled flowers in wax, Because she liked accomplishments in girls. I read a score of books on womanhood To prove, if women do not think at all, They may teach thinking, to a maiden-aunt Or else the author—books demonstrating Their right of comprehending husbands talk When not too deep, and even of answering With pretty may it please you, or so it is, Their rapid insight and fine aptitude, Particular worth and general missionariness, As long as they keep quiet by the fire And never say no when the world says ay, For that is fatal, their angelic reach Of virtue, chiefly used to sit and darn, And fatten household sinners, their, in brief, Potential faculty in everything Of abdicating power in it: she owned She liked a woman to be womanly, And English women, she thanked God and sighed, Some people always sigh in thanking God Were models to the universe. And last I learnt cross-stitch, because she did not like To see me wear the night with empty hands, A-doing nothing. So, my shepherdess Was something after all, the pastoral saints Be praised fort leaning lovelorn with pink eyes To match her shoes, when I mistook the silks; Her head uncrushed by that round weight of hat So strangely similar to the tortoise-shell Which slew the tragic poet. By the way, The works of women are symbolical. We sew, sew, prick our fingers, dull our sight, Producing what? A pair of slippers, sir, To put on when youre weary—or a stool To stumble over and vex you,curse that stool! Or else at best, a cushion, where you lean And sleep, and dream of something we are not, But would be for your sake. Alas, alas! This hurts most, this,that, after all, we are paid The worth of our work, perhaps. In looking down Those years of education, to return I wonder if Brinvilliers suffered more In the water-torture,flood succeeding flood To drench the incapable throat and split the veins,Than I did. Certain of your feebler souls Go out in such a process; many pine To a sick, inodorous light; my own endured: I had relations in the Unseen, and drew The elemental nutriment and heat From nature, as earth feels the sun at nights, Or as a babe sucks surely in the dark. I kept the life, thrust on me, on the outside Of the inner life, with all its ample room For heart and lungs, for will and intellect, Inviolable by conventions. God, I thank thee for that grace of thine! At first, I felt no life which was not patience, did The thing she bade me, without heed to a thing Beyond it, sate in just the chair she placed, With back against the window, to exclude The sight of the great lime-tree on the lawn, Which seemed to have come on purpose from the woods To bring the house a message, ay, and walked Demurely in her carpeted low rooms, As if I should not, harkening my own steps, Misdoubt I was alive. I read her books, Was civil to her cousin, Romney Leigh, Gave ear to her vicar, tea to her visitors, And heard them whisper, when I changed a cup, I blushed for joy at that—The Italian child, For all her blue eyes and her quiet ways, Thrives ill in England: she is paler yet Than when we came the last time; she will die. Will die. My cousin, Romney Leigh, blushed too, With sudden anger, and approaching me Said low between his teeth—Youre wicked now? You wish to die and leave the world a-dusk For others, with your naughty light blown out? I looked into his face defyingly. He might have known, that, being what I was, Twas natural to like to get away As far as dead folk can; and then indeed Some people make no trouble when they die. He turned and went abruptly, slammed the door And shut his dog out. Romney, Romney Leigh. I have not named my cousin hitherto, And yet I used him as a sort of friend; My elder by few years, but cold and shy And absent,tender, when he thought of it, Which scarcely was imperative, grave betimes, As well as early master of Leigh Hall, Whereof the nightmare sate upon his youth Repressing all its seasonable delights, And agonising with a ghastly sense Of universal hideous want and wrong To incriminate possession. When he came From college to the country, very oft He crossed the hills on visits to my aunt, With gifts of blue grapes from the hothouses, A book in one hand, mere statistics, if I chanced to lift the cover count of all The goats whose beards are sprouting down toward hell, Against Gods separating judgment-hour. And she, she almost loved him, even allowed That sometimes he should seem to sigh my way; It made him easier to be pitiful, And sighing was his gift. So, undisturbed At whiles she let him shut my music up And push my needles down, and lead me out To see in that south angle of the house The figs grow black as if by a Tuscan rock, On some light pretext. She would turn her head At other moments, go to fetch a thing, And leave me breath enough to speak with him, For his sake; it was simple. Sometimes too He would have saved me utterly, it seemed, He stood and looked so. Once, he stood so near He dropped a sudden hand upon my head Bent down on womans work, as soft as rain— But then I rose and shook it off as fire, The strangers touch that took my fathers place, Yet dared seem soft. I used him for a friend Before I ever knew him for a friend. Twas better, twas worse also, afterward: We came so close, we saw our differences Too intimately. Always Romney Leigh Was looking for the worms, I for the gods. A godlike nature his; the gods look down, Incurious of themselves; and certainly Tis well I should remember, how, those days, I was a worm too, and he looked on me. A little by his act perhaps, yet more By something in me, surely not my will, I did not die. But slowly, as one in swoon, To whom life creeps back in the form of death, With a sense of separation, a blind pain Of blank obstruction, and a roar i the ears Of visionary chariots which retreat As earth grows clearer,slowly, by degrees, I woke, rose up,where was I? in the world; For uses, therefore, I must count worth while. I had a little chamber in the house, As green as any privet-hedge a bird Might choose to build in, though the nest itself Could show but dead-brown sticks and straws; the walls Were green, the carpet was pure green, the straight Small bed was curtained greenly, and the folds Hung green about the window, which let in The out-door world with all its greenery. You could not push your head out and escape A dash of dawn-dew from the honeysuckle, But so you were baptised into the grace And privilege of seeing  First, the lime, I had enough, there, of the lime, be sure, My morning-dream was often hummed away By the bees in it; past the lime, the lawn, Which, after sweeping broadly round the house, Went trickling through the shrubberies in a stream Of tender turf, and wore and lost itself Among the acacias, over which, you saw The irregular line of elms by the deep lane Which stopped the grounds and dammed the overflow Of arbutus and laurel. Out of sight The lane was; sunk so deep, no foreign tramp Nor drover of wild ponies out of Wales Could guess if ladys hall or tenants lodge Dispensed such odours, though his stick well-crooked Might reach the lowest trail of blossoming briar Which dipped upon the wall. Behind the elms, And through their tops, you saw the folded hills Striped up and down with hedges, burly oaks Projecting from the lines to show themselves Through which my cousin Romneys chimneys smoked As still as when a silent mouth in frost Breathes—showing where the woodlands hid Leigh Hall; While, far above, a jut of table-land, A promontory without water, stretched, You could not catch it if the days were thick, Or took it for a cloud; but, otherwise The vigorous sun would catch it up at eve And use it for an anvil till he had filled The shelves of heaven with burning thunderbolts, And proved he need not rest so early:—then, When all his setting trouble was resolved To a trance of passive glory, you might see In apparition on the golden sky Alas, my Giottos background! the sheep run Along the fine clear outline, small as mice That run along a witchs scarlet thread. Not a grand nature. Not my chestnut-woods Of Vallombrosa, cleaving by the spurs To the precipices. Not my headlong leaps Of waters, that cry out for joy or fear In leaping through the palpitating pines, Like a white soul tossed out to eternity With thrills of time upon it. Not indeed My multitudinous mountains, sitting in The magic circle, with the mutual touch Electric, panting from their full deep hearts Beneath the influent heavens, and waiting for Communion and commission. Italy Is one thing, England one. On English ground You understand the letter,ere the fall, How Adam lived in a garden. All the fields Are tied up fast with hedges, nosegay-like; The hills are crumpled plains, the plains, parterres, The trees, round, woolly, ready to be clipped; And if you seek for any wilderness You find, at best, a park. A nature tamed And grown domestic like a barn-door fowl, Which does not awe you with its claws and beak, Nor tempt you to an eyrie too high up, But which, in cackling, sets you thinking of Your eggs to-morrow at breakfast, in the pause Of finer meditation. Rather say, A sweet familiar nature, stealing in As a dog might, or child, to touch your hand Or pluck your gown, and humbly mind you so Of presence and affection, excellent For inner uses, from the things without. I could not be unthankful, I who was Entreated thus and holpen. In the room I speak of, ere the house was well awake, And also after it was well asleep, I sate alone, and drew the blessing in Of all that nature. With a gradual step, A stir among the leaves, a breath, a ray, It came in softly, while the angels made A place for it beside me. The moon came, And swept my chamber clean of foolish thoughts. The sun came, saying, Shall I lift this light Against the lime-tree, and you will not look? I make the birds sing—listen!. but, for you, God never hears your voice, excepting when You lie upon the bed at nights and weep. Then, something moved me. Then, I wakened up More slowly than I verily write now, But wholly, at last, I wakened, opened wide The window and my soul, and let the airs And out-door sights sweep gradual gospels in, Regenerating what I was. O Life, How oft we throw it off and think, Enough, Enough of life in so much!—heres a cause For rupture;—herein we must break with Life, Or be ourselves unworthy; here we are wronged, Maimed, spoiled for aspiration: farewell Life! —And so, as froward babes, we hide our eyes And think all ended.—Then, Life calls to us In some transformed, apocryphal, new voice, Above us, or below us, or around  Perhaps we name it Natures voice, or Loves, Tricking ourselves, because we are more ashamed To own our compensations than our griefs: Still, Lifes voice!—still, we make our peace with Life. And I, so young then, was not sullen. Soon I used to get up early, just to sit And watch the morning quicken in the grey, And hear the silence open like a flower, Leaf after leaf, and stroke with listless hand The woodbine through the window, till at last I came to do it with a sort of love, At foolish unaware: whereat I smiled, A melancholy smile, to catch myself Smiling for joy. Capacity for joy Admits temptation. It seemed, next, worth while To dodge the sharp sword set against my life; To slip down stairs through all the sleepy house, As mute as any dream there, and escape As a soul from the body, out of doors, Glide through the shrubberies, drop into the lane, And wander on the hills an hour or two, Then back again before the house should stir. Or else I sate on in my chamber green, And lived my life, and thought my thoughts, and prayed My prayers without the vicar; read my books, Without considering whether they were fit To do me good. Mark, there. We get no good By being ungenerous, even to a book, And calculating profits,so much help By so much reading. It is rather when We gloriously forget ourselves, and plunge Soul-forward, headlong, into a books profound, Impassioned for its beauty and salt of truth— Tis then we get the right good from a book. I read much. What my father taught before From many a volume, Love re-emphasised Upon the self-same pages: Theophrast Grew tender with the memory of his eyes, And Ælian made mine wet. The trick of Greek And Latin, he had taught me, as he would Have taught me wrestling or the game of fives If such he had known, most like a shipwrecked man Who heaps his single platter with goats cheese And scarlet berries; or like any man Who loves but one, and so gives all at once, Because he has it, rather than because He counts it worthy. Thus, my father gave; And thus, as did the women formerly By young Achilles, when they pinned the veil Across the boys audacious front, and swept With tuneful laughs the silver-fretted rocks, He wrapt his little daughter in his large Mans doublet, careless did it fit or no. But, after I had read for memory, I read for hope. The path my fathers foot Had trod me out, which suddenly broke off, What time he dropped the wallet of the flesh And passed alone I carried on, and set My child-heart gainst the thorny underwood, To reach the grassy shelter of the trees. Ah, babe i the wood, without a brother-babe! My own self-pity, like the red-breast bird, Flies back to cover all that past with leaves. Sublimest danger, over which none weeps, When any young wayfaring soul goes forth Alone, unconscious of the perilous road, The day-sun dazzling in his limpid eyes, To thrust his own way, he an alien, through The world of books! Ah, you!—you think it fine, You clap hands—A fair day!—you cheer him on, As if the worst, could happen, were to rest Too long beside a fountain. Yet, behold, Behold!—the world of books is still the world; And worldlings in it are less merciful And more puissant. For the wicked there Are winged like angels. Every knife that strikes, Is edged from elemental fire to assail A spiritual life. The beautiful seems right By force of beauty, and the feeble wrong Because of weakness. Power is justified, Though armed against St. Michael. Many a crown Covers bald foreheads. In the book-world, true, Theres no lack, neither, of Gods saints and kings, That shake the ashes of the grave aside From their calm locks, and undiscomfited Look stedfast truths against Times changing mask. True, many a prophet teaches in the roads; True, many a seer pulls down the flaming heavens Upon his own head in strong martyrdom, In order to light men a moments space. But stay!—who judges?—who distinguishes Twixt Saul and Nahash justly, at first sight, And leaves king Saul precisely at the sin, To serve king David? who discerns at once The sound of the trumpets, when the trumpets blow For Alaric as well as Charlemagne? Who judges prophets, and can tell true seers From conjurors? The child, there? Would you leave That child to wander in a battle-field And push his innocent smile against the guns? Or even in the catacombs,his torch Grown ragged in the fluttering air, and all The dark a-mutter round him? not a child! I read books bad and good—some bad and good At once: good aims not always make good books: Well-tempered spades turn up ill-smelling soils In digging vineyards, even: books, that prove Gods being so definitely, that mans doubt Grows self-defined the other side the line, Made atheist by suggestion; moral books, Exasperating to license; genial books, Discounting from the human dignity; And merry books, which set you weeping when The sun shines, ay, and melancholy books, Which make you laugh that any one should weep In this disjointed life, for one wrong more. The world of books is still the world, I write, And both worlds have Gods providence, thank God, To keep and hearten: with some struggle, indeed, Among the breakers, some hard swimming through The deeps—I lost breath in my soul sometimes, And cried, God save me if theres any God, But, even so, God saved me; and, being dashed From error on to error, every turn Still brought me nearer to the central truth. I thought so. All this anguish in the thick Of mens opinions,press and counterpress, Now up, now down, now underfoot, and now Emergent,all the best of it, perhaps, But throws you back upon a noble trust And use of your own instinct, merely proves Pure reason stronger than bare inference At strongest. Try it, fix against heavens wall Your scaling ladders of high logic—mount Step by step!—Sight goes faster; that still ray Which strikes out from you, how, you cannot tell, And why, you know not—did you eliminate, That such as you, indeed, should analyse? Goes straight and fast as light, and high as God. The cygnet finds the water; but the man Is born in ignorance of his element, And feels out blind at first, disorganised By sin i the blood, his spirit-insight dulled And crossed by his sensations. Presently We feel it quicken in the dark sometimes; Then, mark, be reverent, be obedient, For those dumb motions of imperfect life Are oracles of vital Deity Attesting the Hereafter. Let who says The souls a clean white paper, rather say, A palimpsest, a prophets holograph Defiled, erased and covered by a monks, The apocalypse, by a Longus! poring on Which obscene text, we may discern perhaps Some fair, fine trace of what was written once, Some upstroke of an alpha and omega Expressing the old scripture. Books, books, books! I had found the secret of a garret-room Piled high with cases in my fathers name; Piled high, packed large, where, creeping in and out Among the giant fossils of my past, Like some small nimble mouse between the ribs Of a mastodon, I nibbled here and there At this or that box, pulling through the gap, In heats of terror, haste, victorious joy, The first book first. And how I felt it beat Under my pillow, in the mornings dark, An hour before the sun would let me read! My books! At last, because the time was ripe, I chanced upon the poets. As the earth Plunges in fury, when the internal fires Have reached and pricked her heart, and, throwing flat The marts and temples, the triumphal gates And towers of observation, clears herself To elemental freedom—thus, my soul, At poetrys divine first finger-touch, Let go conventions and sprang up surprised, Convicted of the great eternities Before two worlds. Whats this, Aurora Leigh, You write so of the poets, and not laugh? Those virtuous liars, dreamers after dark, Exaggerators of the sun and moon, And soothsayers in a tea-cup? I write so Of the only truth-tellers, now left to God, The only speakers of essential truth, Opposed to relative, comparative, And temporal truths; the only holders by His sun-skirts, through conventional grey glooms; The only teachers who instruct mankind, From just a shadow on a charnel-wall, To find mans veritable stature out, Erect, sublime, the measure of a man, And thats the measure of an angel, says The apostle. Ay, and while your common men Build pyramids, gauge railroads, reign, reap, dine, And dust the flaunty carpets of the world For kings to walk on, or our senators, The poet suddenly will catch them up With his voice like a thunder,This is soul, This is life, this word is being said in heaven, Heres God down on us! what are you about? How all those workers start amid their work, Look round, look up, and feel, a moments space, That carpet-dusting, though a pretty trade, Is not the imperative labour after all. My own best poets, am I one with you, That thus I love you, or but one through love? Does all this smell of thyme about my feet Conclude my visit to your holy hill In personal presence, or but testify The rustling of your vesture through my dreams With influent odours? When my joy and pain, My thought and aspiration, like the stops Of pipe or flute, are absolutely dumb If not melodious, do you play on me, My pipers, and if, sooth, you did not blow, Would no sound come? or is the music mine, As a mans voice or breath is called his own, Inbreathed by the Life-breather? Theres a doubt For cloudy seasons! But the sun was high When first I felt my pulses set themselves For concords; when the rhythmic turbulence Of blood and brain swept outward upon words, As wind upon the alders, blanching them By turning up their under-natures till They trembled in dilation. O delight And triumph of the poet, who would say A mans mere yes, a womans common no, A little human hope of that or this, And says the word so that it burns you through With a special revelation, shakes the heart Of all the men and women in the world, As if one came back from the dead and spoke, With eyes too happy, a familiar thing Become divine i the utterance! while for him The poet, the speaker, he expands with joy; The palpitating angel in his flesh Thrills inly with consenting fellowship To those innumerous spirits who sun themselves Outside of time. O life, O poetry, —Which means life in life! cognisant of life Beyond this blood-beat, passionate for truth Beyond these senses, poetry, my life, My eagle, with both grappling feet still hot From Zeuss thunder, who has ravished me Away from all the shepherds, sheep, and dogs, And set me in the Olympian roar and round Of luminous faces, for a cup-bearer, To keep the mouths of all the godheads moist For everlasting laughters, I, myself, Half drunk across the beaker, with their eyes! How those gods look! Enough so, Ganymede. We shall not bear above a round or two— We drop the golden cup at Herés foot And swoon back to the earth, and find ourselves Face-down among the pine-cones, cold with dew, While the dogs bark, and many a shepherd scoffs, Whats come now to the youth? Such ups and downs Have poets. Am I such indeed? The name Is royal, and to sign it like a queen, Is what I dare not, though some royal blood Would seem to tingle in me now and then, With sense of power and ache, with imposthumes And manias usual to the race. Howbeit I dare not: tis too easy to go mad, And ape a Bourbon in a crown of straws; The things too common. Many fervent souls Strike rhyme on rhyme, who would strike steel on steel If steel had offered, in a restless heat Of doing something. Many tender souls Have strung their losses on a rhyming thread, As children, cowslips:—the more pains they take, The work more withers. Young men, ay, and maids, Too often sow their wild oats in tame verse, Before they sit down under their own vine And live for use. Alas, near all the birds Will sing at dawn, and yet we do not take The chaffering swallow for the holy lark. In those days, though, I never analysed Myself even. All analysis comes late. You catch a sight of Nature, earliest, In full front sun-face, and your eyelids wink And drop before the wonder oft; you miss The form, through seeing the light. I lived, those days, And wrote because I lived—unlicensed else: My heart beat in my brain. Lifes violent flood Abolished bounds, and, which my neighbours field, Which mine, what mattered? It is so in youth. We play at leap-frog over the god Term; The love within us and the love without Are mixed, confounded; if we are loved or love, We scarce distinguish. So, with other power. Being acted on and acting seem the same: In that first onrush of lifes chariot-wheels, We know not if the forests move or we. And so, like most young poets, in a flush Of individual life, I poured myself Along the veins of others, and achieved Mere lifeless imitations of live verse, And made the living answer for the dead, Profaning nature. Touch not, do not taste, Nor handle, were too legal, who write young: We beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs, As if still ignorant of counterpoint; We call the Muse  O Muse, benignant Muse!— As if we had seen her purple-braided head With the eyes in it, start between the boughs As often as a stags. What make-believe, With so much earnest! what effete results, From virile efforts! what cold wire-drawn odes, From such white heats!—bucolics, where the cows Would scare the writer if they splashed the mud In lashing off the flies, didactics, driven Against the heels of what the master said; And counterfeiting epics, shrill with trumps A babe might blow between two straining cheeks Of bubbled rose, to make his mother laugh; And elegiac griefs, and songs of love, Like cast-off nosegays picked up on the road, The worse for being warm: all these things, writ On happy mornings, with a morning heart, That leaps for love, is active for resolve, Weak for art only. Oft, the ancient forms Will thrill, indeed, in carrying the young blood. The wine-skins, now and then, a little warped, Will crack even, as the new wine gurgles in. Spare the old bottles!—spill not the new wine. By Keatss soul, the man who never stepped In gradual progress like another man, But, turning grandly on his central self, Ensphered himself in twenty perfect years And died, not young, the life of a long life, Distilled to a mere drop, falling like a tear Upon the worlds cold cheek to make it burn For ever; by that strong excepted soul, I count it strange, and hard to understand, That nearly all young poets should write old; That Pope was sexagenarian at sixteen, And beardless Byron academical, And so with others. It may be, perhaps, Such have not settled long and deep enough In trance, to attain to clairvoyance, and still The memory mixes with the vision, spoils, And works it turbid. Or perhaps, again, In order to discover the Muse-Sphinx, The melancholy desert must sweep round, Behind you, as before.— For me, I wrote False poems, like the rest, and thought them true, Because myself was true in writing them. I, peradventure, have writ true ones since With less complacence. But I could not hide My quickening inner life from those at watch. They saw a light at a window now and then, They had not set there. Who had set it there? My fathers sister started when she caught My soul agaze in my eyes. She could not say I had no business with a sort of soul, But plainly she objected, and demurred, That souls were dangerous things to carry straight Through all the spilt saltpetre of the world. She said sometimes, Aurora, have you done Your task this morning?—have you read that book? And are you ready for the crochet here?— As if she said, I know theres something wrong; I know I have not ground you down enough To flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust For household uses and proprieties, Before the rain has got into my barn And set the grains a-sprouting. What, youre green With out-door impudence? you almost grow? To which I answered, Would she hear my task, And verify my abstract of the book? And should I sit down to the crochet work? Was such her pleasure?,Then I sate and teased The patient needle till it spilt the thread, Which oozed off from it in meandering lace From hour to hour. I was not, therefore, sad; My soul was singing at a work apart Behind the wall of sense, as safe from harm As sings the lark when sucked up out of sight, In vortices of glory and blue air. And so, through forced work and spontaneous work, The inner life informed the outer life, Reduced the irregular blood to settled rhythms, Made cool the forehead with fresh-sprinkling dreams, And, rounding to the spheric soul the thin Pined body, struck a colour up the cheeks, Though somewhat faint. I clenched my brows across My blue eyes greatening in the looking-glass, And said, Well live, Aurora! well be strong. The dogs are on us—but we will not die. Whoever lives true life, will love true love. I learnt to love that England. Very oft, Before the day was born, or otherwise Through secret windings of the afternoons, I threw my hunters off and plunged myself Among the deep hills, as a hunted stag Will take the waters, shivering with the fear And passion of the course. And when, at last Escaped, so many a green slope built on slope Betwixt me and the enemys house behind, I dared to rest, or wander, like a rest Made sweeter for the step upon the grass, And view the grounds most gentle dimplement, As if Gods finger touched but did not press In making England! such an up and down Of verdure, nothing too much up or down, A ripple of land; such little hills, the sky Can stoop to tenderly and the wheatfields climb; Such nooks of valleys, lined with orchises, Fed full of noises by invisible streams; And open pastures, where you scarcely tell White daisies from white dew, at intervals The mythic oaks and elm-trees standing out Self-poised upon their prodigy of shade, I thought my fathers land was worthy too Of being my Shakspeares. Very oft alone, Unlicensed; not unfrequently with leave To walk the third with Romney and his friend The rising painter, Vincent Carrington, Whom men judge hardly, as bee-bonnetted, Because he holds that, paint a body well, You paint a soul by implication, like The grand first Master. Pleasant walks! for if He said,When I was last in Italy,It sounded as an instrument thats played Too far off for the tune—and yet its fine To listen. Ofter we walked only two, If cousin Romney pleased to walk with me. We read, or talked, or quarrelled, as it chanced: We were not lovers, nor even friends well-matched— Say rather, scholars upon different tracks, And thinkers disagreed; he, overfull Of what is, and I, haply, overbold For what might be. But then the thrushes sang, And shook my pulses and the elms new leaves, And then I turned, and held my finger up, And bade him mark that, howsoeer the world Went ill, as he related, certainly The thrushes still sang in it.—At which word His brow would soften, and he bore with me In melancholy patience, not unkind, While, breaking into voluble ecstacy, I flattered all the beauteous country round, As poets use,the skies, the clouds, the fields, The happy violets hiding from the roads The primroses run down to, carrying gold, The tangled hedgerows, where the cows push out Impatient horns and tolerant churning mouths Twixt dripping ash-boughs, hedgerows all alive With birds and gnats and large white butterflies Which look as if the May-flower had caught life And palpitated forth upon the wind, Hills, vales, woods, netted in a silver mist, Farms, granges, doubled up among the hills, And cattle grazing in the watered vales, And cottage-chimneys smoking from the woods, And cottage-gardens smelling everywhere, Confused with smell of orchards. See, I said, And see! is God not with us on the earth? And shall we put Him down by aught we do? Who says theres nothing for the poor and vile Save poverty and wickedness? behold! And ankle-deep in English grass I leaped, And clapped my hands, and called all very fair. In the beginning when God called all good, Even then, was evil near us, it is writ. But we, indeed, who call things good and fair, The evil is upon us while we speak; Deliver us from evil, let us pray. SECOND BOOK. Times followed one another. Came a morn I stood upon the brink of twenty years, And looked before and after, as I stood Woman and artist, either incomplete, Both credulous of completion. There I held The whole creation in my little cup, And smiled with thirsty lips before I drank, Good health to you and me, sweet neighbour mine, And all these peoples. I was glad, that day; The June was in me, with its multitudes Of nightingales all singing in the dark, And rosebuds reddening where the calyx split. I felt so young, so strong, so sure of God! So glad, I could not choose be very wise! And, old at twenty, was inclined to pull My childhood backward in a childish jest To see the face oft once more, and farewell! In which fantastic mood I bounded forth At early morning, would not wait so long As even to snatch my bonnet by the strings, But, brushing a green trail across the lawn With my gown in the dew, took will and way Among the acacias of the shrubberies, To fly my fancies in the open air And keep my birthday, till my aunt awoke To stop good dreams. Meanwhile I murmured on, As honeyed bees keep humming to themselves; The worthiest poets have remained uncrowned Till death has bleached their foreheads to the bone, And so with me it must be, unless I prove Unworthy of the grand adversity, And certainly I would not fail so much. What, therefore, if I crown myself to-day In sport, not pride, to learn the feel of it, Before my brows be numb as Dantes own To all the tender pricking of such leaves? Such leaves! what leaves? I pulled the branches down, To choose from. Not the bay! I choose no bay; The fates deny us if we are overbold: Nor myrtle—which means chiefly love; and love Is something awful which one dares not touch So early o mornings. This verbena strains The point of passionate fragrance; and hard by, This guelder-rose, at far too slight a beck Of the wind, will toss about her flower-apples. Ah—theres my choice, that ivy on the wall, That headlong ivy! not a leaf will grow But thinking of a wreath. Large leaves, smooth leaves, Serrated like my vines, and half as green. I like such ivy; bold to leap a height Twas strong to climb! as good to grow on graves As twist about a thyrsus; pretty too, And thats not ill when twisted round a comb, Thus speaking to myself, half singing it, Because some thoughts are fashioned like a bell To ring with once being touched, I drew a wreath Drenched, blinding me with dew, across my brow, And fastening it behind so,turning faced,My public!—cousin Romney—with a mouth Twice graver than his eyes. I stood there fixed— My arms up, like the caryatid, sole Of some abolished temple, helplessly Persistent in a gesture which derides A former purpose. Yet my blush was flame, As if from flax, not stone. Aurora Leigh, The earliest of Auroras! Hand stretched out I clasped, as shipwrecked men will clasp a hand, Indifferent to the sort of palm. The tide Had caught me at my pastime, writing down My foolish name too near upon the sea Which drowned me with a blush as foolish. You, My cousin! The smile died out in his eyes And dropped upon his lips, a cold dead weight, For just a moment  Heres a book, I found! No name writ on it—poems, by the form; Some Greek upon the margin, ladys Greek, Without the accents. Read it? Not a word. I saw at once the thing had witchcraft int Whereof the reading calls up dangerous spirits; I rather bring it to the witch. My book! You found it  In the hollow by the stream, That beech leans down into—of which you said, The Oread in it has a Naiads heart And pines for waters. Thank you. Rather you, My cousin! that I have seen you not too much A witch, a poet, scholar, and the rest, To be a woman also. With a glance The smile rose in his eyes again, and touched The ivy on my forehead, light as air. I answered gravely, Poets needs must be Or men or women—mores the pity. Ah, But men, and still less women, happily, Scarce need be poets. Keep to the green wreath, Since even dreaming of the stone and bronze Brings headaches, pretty cousin, and defiles The clean white morning dresses. So you judge! Because I love the beautiful, I must Love pleasure chiefly, and be overcharged For ease and whiteness! Well—you know the world, And only miss your cousin; tis not much!— But learn this: I would rather take my part With Gods Dead, who afford to walk in white Yet spread His glory, than keep quiet here, And gather up my feet from even a step, For fear to soil my gown in so much dust. I choose to walk at all risks.—Here, if heads That hold a rhythmic thought, must ache perforce, For my part, I choose headaches, and todays My birthday. Dear Aurora, choose instead To cure such. You have balsams. I perceive!— The headache is too noble for my sex. You think the heartache would sound decenter, Since thats the womans special, proper ache, And altogether tolerable, except To a woman. Saying which, I loosed my wreath, And, swinging it beside me as I walked, Half petulant, half playful, as we walked, I sent a sidelong look to find his thought, As falcon set on falconers finger may, With sidelong head, and startled, braving eye, Which means, Youll see—youll see! Ill soon take flight— You shall not hinder. He, as shaking out His hand and answering Fly then, did not speak, Except by such a gesture. Silently We paced, until, just coming into sight Of the house-windows, he abruptly caught At one end of the swinging wreath, and said Aurora! There I stopped short, breath and all. Aurora, lets be serious, and throw by This game of head and heart. Life means, be sure, Both heart and head, both active, both complete, And both in earnest. Men and women make The world, as head and heart make human life. Work man, work woman, since theres work to do In this beleaguered earth, for head and heart, And thought can never do the work of love! But work for ends, I mean for uses; not For such sleek fringes do you call them ends? Still less Gods glory as we sew ourselves Upon the velvet of those baldaquins Held twixt us and the sun. That book of yours, I have not read a page of; but I toss A rose up—it falls calyx down, you see!. The chances are that, being a woman, young, And pure, with such a pair of large, calm eyes,You write as well,and ill,upon the whole, As other women. If as well, what then? If even a little better,still, what then? We want the Best in art now, or no art. The time is done for facile settings up Of minnow gods, nymphs here, and tritons there; The polytheists have gone out in God, That unity of Bests. No best, no God!— And so with art, we say. Give arts divine, Direct, indubitable, real as grief, Or leave us to the grief we grow ourselves Divine by overcoming with mere hope And most prosaic patience. You, you are young As Eve with natures daybreak on her face; But this same world you are come to, dearest coz, Has done with keeping birthdays, saves her wreaths To hang upon her ruins, and forgets To rhyme the cry with which she still beats back Those savage, hungry dogs that hunt her down To the empty grave of Christ. The worlds hard pressed; The sweat of labour in the early curse Has turning acrid in six thousand years Become the sweat of torture. Who has time, An hours time,think!. to sit upon a bank And hear the cymbal tinkle in white hands? When Egypts slain, I say, let Miriam sing!— Before,wheres Moses? Ah—exactly that! Wheres Moses?—is a Moses to be found?— Youll seek him vainly in the bulrushes, While I in vain touch cymbals. Yet, concede, Such sounding brass has done some actual good, The application in a womans hand, If that were credible, being scarcely spoilt, In colonising beehives. There it is!— You play beside a death-bed like a child, Yet measure to yourself a prophets place To teach the living. None of all these things, Can women understand. You generalise Oh, nothing!—not even grief! Your quick-breathed hearts, So sympathetic to the personal pang, Close, on each separate knife-stroke, yielding up A whole life at each wound; incapable Of deepening, widening a large lap of life To hold the world-full woe. The human race To you means, such a child, or such a man, You saw one morning waiting in the cold, Beside that gate, perhaps. You gather up A few such cases, and, when strong, sometimes Will write of factories and of slaves, as if Your father were a negro, and your son A spinner in the mills. Alls yours and you, All, coloured with your blood, or otherwise Just nothing to you. Why, I call you hard To general suffering. Heres the world half blind With intellectual light, half brutalised With civilisation, having caught the plague In silks from Tarsus, shrieking east and west Along a thousand railroads, mad with pain And sin too!. does one woman of you all, You who weep easily grow pale to see This tiger shake his cage?—does one of you Stand still from dancing, stop from stringing pearls, And pine and die, because of the great sum Of universal anguish?—Show me a tear Wet as Cordelias, in eyes bright as yours, Because the world is mad! You cannot count, That you should weep for this account, not you! You weep for what you know. A red-haired child Sick in a fever, if you touch him once, Though but so little as with a finger-tip, Will set you weeping; but a million sick,You could as soon weep for the rule of three, Or compound fractions. Therefore, this same world Uncomprehended by you, must remain Uninfluenced by you.—Women as you are, Mere women, personal and passionate, You give us doating mothers, and chaste wives, Sublime Madonnas, and enduring saints! We get no Christ from you, and verily We shall not get a poet, in my mind. With which conclusion you conclude  But this— That you, Aurora, with the large live brow And steady eyelids, cannot condescend To play at art, as children play at swords, To show a pretty spirit, chiefly admired Because true action is impossible. You never can be satisfied with praise Which men give women when they judge a book Not as mere work, but as mere womans work, Expressing the comparative respect Which means the absolute scorn. Oh, excellent! What grace! what facile turns! what fluent sweeps! What delicate discernment,almost thought! The book does honour to the sex, we hold. Among our female authors we make room For this fair writer, and congratulate The country that produces in these times Such women, competent to,spell. Stop there! I answered—burning through his thread of talk With a quick flame of emotion, You have read My soul, if not my book, and argue well I would not condescend,we will not say To such a kind of praise, a worthless end Is praise of all kinds but to such a use Of holy art and golden life. I am young, And peradventure weak—you tell me so— Through being a woman. And, for all the rest, Take thanks for justice. I would rather dance At fairs on tight-rope, till the babies dropped Their gingerbread for joy, than shift the types For tolerable verse, intolerable To men who act and suffer. Better far, Pursue a frivolous trade by serious means, Than a sublime art frivolously. You, Choose nobler work than either, O moist eyes, And hurrying lips, and heaving heart! We are young Aurora, you and I. The world,look round,The world, were come to late, is swollen hard With perished generations and their sins: The civilisers spade grinds horribly On dead mens bones, and cannot turn up soil Thats otherwise than fetid. All success Proves partial failure; all advance implies Whats left behind; all triumph, something crushed At the chariot-wheels; all government, some wrong: And rich men make the poor, who curse the rich, Who agonise together, rich and poor, Under and over, in the social spasm And crisis of the ages. Heres an age, That makes its own vocation! here, we have stepped Across the bounds of time! heres nought to see, But just the rich man and just Lazarus, And both in torments; with a mediate gulph, Though not a hint of Abrahams bosom. Who, Being man and human, can stand calmly by And view these things, and never tease his soul For some great cure? No physic for this grief, In all the earth and heavens too? You believe In God, for your part?—ay? that He who makes, Can make good things from ill things, best from worst, As men plant tulips upon dunghills when They wish them finest? True. A death-heat is The same as life-heat, to be accurate; And in all nature is no death at all, As men account of death, as long as God Stands witnessing for life perpetually, By being just God. Thats abstract truth, I know, Philosophy, or sympathy with God: But I, I sympathise with man, not God, I think I was a man for chiefly this; And when I stand beside a dying bed, Its death to me. Observe, it had not much Consoled the race of mastodons to know Before they went to fossil, that anon Their place should quicken with the elephant; They were not elephants but mastodons: And I, a man, as men are now, and not As men may be hereafter, feel with men In the agonising present. Is it so, I said, my cousin? is the world so bad, While I hear nothing of it through the trees? The world was always evil, but so bad? So bad, Aurora. Dear, my soul is grey With poring over the long sum of ill; So much for vice, so much for discontent, So much for the necessities of power, So much for the connivances of fear, Coherent in statistical despairs With such a total of distracted life,To see it down in figures on a page, Plain, silent, clear,as God sees through the earth The sense of all the graves!. thats terrible For one who is not God, and cannot right The wrong he looks on. May I choose indeed But vow away my years, my means, my aims, Among the helpers, if theres any help In such a social strait? The common blood That swings along my veins, is strong enough To draw me to this duty. Then I spoke. I have not stood long on the strand of life, And these salt waters have had scarcely time To creep so high up as to wet my feet. I cannot judge these tides—I shall, perhaps. A womans always younger than a man At equal years, because she is disallowed Maturing by the outdoor sun and air, And kept in long-clothes past the age to walk. Ah well, I know you men judge otherwise! You think a woman ripens as a peach, In the cheeks, chiefly. Pass it to me now; I'm young in age, and younger still, I think, As a woman. But a child may say amen To a bishops prayer and see the way it goes; And I, incapable to loose the knot Of social questions, can approve, applaud August compassion, christian thoughts that shoot Beyond the vulgar white of personal aims. Accept my reverence. There he glowed on me With all his face and eyes. No other help? Said he—no more than so? What help? I asked. Youd scorn my help, as Natures self, you say, Has scorned to put her music in my mouth, Because a womans. Do you now turn round And ask for what a woman cannot give? For what she only can, I turn and ask, He answered, catching up my hands in his, And dropping on me from his high-eaved brow The full weight of his soul, I ask for love, And that, she can; for life in fellowship Through bitter duties—that, I know she can; For wifehood,will she? Now, I said, may God Be witness twixt us two! and with the word, Meseemed I floated into a sudden light Above his stature, am I proved too weak To stand alone, yet strong enough to bear Such leaners on my shoulder? poor to think, Yet rich enough to sympathise with thought? Incompetent to sing, as blackbirds can, Yet competent to love, like him? I paused: Perhaps I darkened, as the light-house will That turns upon the sea. Its always so! Anything does for a wife. Aurora, dear, And dearly honoured,he pressed in at once With eager utterance, you translate me ill. I do not contradict my thought of you Which is most reverent, with another thought Found less so. If your sex is weak for art, And I who said so, did but honour you By using truth in courtship it is strong For life and duty. Place your fecund heart In mine, and let us blossom for the world That wants loves colour in the grey of time. With all my talk I can but set you where You look down coldly on the arena-heaps Of headless bodies, shapeless, indistinct! The Judgment-Angel scarce would find his way Through such a heap of generalised distress, To the individual man with lips and eyes— Much less Aurora. Ah, my sweet, come down, And, hand in hand, well go where yours shall touch These victims, one by one! till, one by one, The formless, nameless trunk of every man Shall seem to wear a head, with hair you know, And every woman catch your mothers face To melt you into passion. I am a girl, I answered slowly; you do well to name My mothers face. Though far too early, alas, Gods hand did interpose twixt it and me, I know so much of love, as used to shine In that face and another. Just so much; No more indeed at all. I have not seen So much love since, I pray you pardon me, As answers even to make a marriage with, In this cold land of England. What you love, Is not a woman, Romney, but a cause: You want a helpmate, not a mistress, sir, A wife to help your ends,in her no end! Your cause is noble, your ends excellent, But I, being most unworthy of these and that, Do otherwise conceive of love. Farewell. Farewell, Aurora? you reject me thus? He said. Why, sir, you are married long ago. You have a wife already whom you love, Your social theory. Bless you both, I say. For my part, I am scarcely meek enough To be the handmaid of a lawful spouse. Do I look a Hagar, think you? So, you jest! Nay so, I speak in earnest, I replied. You treat of marriage too much like, at least, A chief apostle; you would bear with you A wife,a sister,shall we speak it out? A sister of charity. Then, must it be Indeed farewell? And was I so far wrong In hope and in illusion, when I took The woman to be nobler than the man, Yourself the noblest woman, in the use And comprehension of what love is, love, That generates the likeness of itself Through all heroic duties? so far wrong, In saying bluntly, venturing truth on love, Come, human creature, love and work with me, Instead of, Lady, thou art wondrous fair, And, where the Graces walk before, the Muse Will follow at the lighting of their eyes, And where the Muse walks, lovers need to creep: Turn round and love me, or I die of love. With quiet indignation I broke in. You misconceive the question like a man, Who sees a woman as the complement Of his sex merely. You forget too much That every creature, female as the male, Stands single in responsible act and thought, As also in birth and death. Whoever says To a loyal woman, Love and work with me, Will get fair answers, if the work and love, Being good themselves, are good for her—the best She was born for. Women of a softer mood, Surprised by men when scarcely awake to life, Will sometimes only hear the first word, love, And catch up with it any kind of work, Indifferent, so that dear love go with it: I do not blame such women, though, for love, They pick much oakum; earths fanatics make Too frequently heavens saints. But me, your work Is not the best for, nor your love the best, Nor able to commend the kind of work For loves sake merely. Ah, you force me, sir, To be over-bold in speaking of myself, I, too, have my vocation, work to do, The heavens and earth have set me, since I changed My fathers face for theirs, and, though your world Were twice as wretched as you represent, Most serious work, most necessary work, As any of the economists. Reform, Make trade a Christian possibility, And individual right no general wrong; Wipe out earths furrows of the Thine and Mine, And leave one green, for men to play at bowls, With innings for them all!. what then, indeed, If mortals were not greater by the head Than any of their prosperities? what then, Unless the artist keep up open roads Betwixt the seen and unseen, bursting through The best of your conventions with his best, The speakable, imaginable best God bids him speak, to prove what lies beyond Both speech and imagination? A starved man Exceeds a fat beast: well not barter, sir, The beautiful for barley.—And, even so, I hold you will not compass your poor ends Of barley-feeding and material ease, Without a poets individualism To work your universal. It takes a soul, To move a body: it takes a high-souled man, To move the masses,even to a cleaner stye: It takes the ideal, to blow a hairs-breadth off The dust of the actual.—Ah, your Fouriers failed, Because not poets enough to understand That life develops from within.——For me, Perhaps I am not worthy, as you say, Of work like this!. perhaps a womans soul Aspires, and not creates! yet we aspire, And yet Ill try out your perhapses, sir; And if I fail,why, burn me up my straw Like other false works—Ill not ask for grace, Your scorn is better, cousin Romney. I Who love my art, would never wish it lower To suit my stature. I may love my art. Youll grant that even a woman may love art, Seeing that to waste true love on anything, Is womanly, past question. I retain The very last word which I said, that day, As you the creaking of the door, years past, Which let upon you such disabling news You ever after have been graver. He, His eyes, the motions in his silent mouth, Were fiery points on which my words were caught, Transfixed for ever in my memory For his sake, not their own. And yet I know I did not love him,nor he me,thats sure  And what I said, is unrepented of, As truth is always. Yet,a princely man!— If hard to me, heroic for himself! He bears down on me through the slanting years, The stronger for the distance. If he had loved, Ay, loved me, with that retributive face,I might have been a common woman now, And happier, less known and less left alone; Perhaps a better woman after all, With chubby children hanging on my neck To keep me low and wise. Ah me, the vines That bear such fruit, are proud to stoop with it. The palm stands upright in a realm of sand. And I, who spoke the truth then, stand upright, Still worthy of having spoken out the truth, By being content I spoke it, though it set Him there, me here.—O womans vile remorse, To hanker after a mere name, a show, A supposition, a potential love! Does every man who names love in our lives, Become a power for that? is loves true thing So much best to us, that what personates love Is next best? A potential love, forsooth! We are not so vile. No, no—he cleaves, I think, This man, this image,chiefly for the wrong And shock he gave my life, in finding me Precisely where the devil of my youth Had set me, on those mountain-peaks of hope All glittering with the dawn-dew, all erect And famished for the morning, saying, while I looked for empire and much tribute, Come, I have some worthy work for thee below. Come, sweep my barns, and keep my hospitals, And I will pay thee with a current coin Which men give women. As we spoke, the grass Was trod in haste beside us, and my aunt, With smile distorted by the sun, face, voice, As much at issue with the summer-day As if you brought a candle out of doors, Broke in with, Romney, here!—My child, entreat Your cousin to the house, and have your talk, If girls must talk upon their birthdays. Come, He answered for me calmly, with pale lips That seemed to motion for a smile in vain. The talk is ended, madam, where we stand. Your brothers daughter has dismissed me here; And all my answer can be better said Beneath the trees, than wrong by such a word Your houses hospitalities. Farewell. With that he vanished. I could hear his heel Ring bluntly in the lane, as down he leapt The short way from us.—Then, a measured speech Withdrew me. What means this, Aurora Leigh? My brothers daughter has dismissed my guests? The lion in me felt the keepers voice, Through all its quivering dewlaps: I was quelled Before her, meekened to the child she knew: I prayed her pardon, said, I had little thought To give dismissal to a guest of hers, In letting go a friend of mine, who came To take me into service as a wife, No more than that, indeed. No more, no more? Pray Heaven, she answered, that I was not mad. I could not mean to tell her to her face That Romney Leigh had asked me for a wife, And I refused him? Did he ask? I said; I think he rather stooped to take me up For certain uses which he found to do For something called a wife. He never asked. What stuff! she answered; are they queens, these girls? They must have mantles, stitched with twenty silks, Spread out upon the ground, before theyll step One footstep for the noblest lover born. But I am born, I said with firmness, I, To walk another way than his, dear aunt. You walk, you walk! A babe at thirteen months Will walk as well as you, she cried in haste, Without a steadying finger. Why, you child, God help you, you are groping in the dark, For all this sunlight. You suppose, perhaps, That you, sole offspring of an opulent man, Are rich and free to choose a way to walk? You think, and its a reasonable thought, That I besides, being well to do in life, Will leave my handful in my nieces hand When death shall paralyse these fingers? Pray, Pray, child, albeit I know you love me not, As if you loved me, that I may not die! For when I die and leave you, out you go, Unless I make room for you in my grave Unhoused, unfed, my dear, poor brothers lamb, Ah heaven, that pains!—without a right to crop A single blade of grass beneath these trees, Or cast a lambs small shadow on the lawn, Unfed, unfolded! Ah, my brother, heres The fruit you planted in your foreign loves!— Ay, theres the fruit he planted! never look Astonished at me with your mothers eyes, For it was they, who set you where you are, An undowered orphan. Child, your fathers choice Of that said mother, disinherited His daughter, his and hers. Men do not think Of sons and daughters, when they fall in love, So much more than of sisters; otherwise, He would have paused to ponder what he did, And shrunk before that clause in the entail Excluding offspring by a foreign wife, The clause set up a hundred years ago By a Leigh who wedded a French dancing-girl And had his heart danced over in return; But this man shrunk at nothing, never thought Of you, Aurora, any more than me— Your mother must have been a pretty thing, For all the coarse Italian blacks and browns, To make a good man, which my brother was, Unchary of the duties to his house; But so it fell indeed. Our cousin Vane, Vane Leigh, the father of this Romney, wrote Directly on your birth, to Italy, I ask your baby daughter for my son In whom the entail now merges by the law. Betroth her to us out of love, instead Of colder reasons, and she shall not lose By love or law from henceforth—so he wrote; A generous cousin, was my cousin Vane. Remember how he drew you to his knee The year you came here, just before he died, And hollowed out his hands to hold your cheeks, And wished them redder, you remember Vane? And now his son who represents our house And holds the fiefs and manors in his place, To whom reverts my pittance when I die, Except a few books and a pair of shawls The boy is generous like him, and prepared To carry out his kindest word and thought To you, Aurora. Yes, a fine young man Is Romney Leigh; although the sun of youth Has shone too straight upon his brain, I know, And fevered him with dreams of doing good To good-for-nothing people. But a wife Will put all right, and stroke his temples cool With healthy touches  I broke in at that. I could not lift my heavy heart to breathe Till then, but then I raised it, and it fell In broken words like these—No need to wait. The dream of doing good to,me, at least, Is ended, without waiting for a wife To cool the fever for him. Weve escaped That danger,thank Heaven for it. You, she cried, Have got a fever. What, I talk and talk An hour long to you, I instruct you how You cannot eat or drink or stand or sit, Or even die, like any decent wretch In all this unroofed and unfurnished world, Without your cousin, and you still maintain Theres room twixt him and you, for flirting fans And running knots in eyebrows! You must have A pattern lover sighing on his knee: You do not count enough a noble heart, Above book-patterns, which this very morn Unclosed itself, in two dear fathers names, To embrace your orphaned life! fie, fie! But stay, I write a word, and counteract this sin. She would have turned to leave me, but I clung. O sweet my fathers sister, hear my word Before you write yours. Cousin Vane did well, And cousin Romney well, and I well too, In casting back with all my strength and will The good they meant me. O my God, my God! God meant me good, too, when he hindered me From saying yes this morning. If you write A word, it shall be no. I say no, no! I tie up no upon His altar-horns, Quite out of reach of perjury! At least My soul is not a pauper; I can live At least my souls life, without alms from men; And if it must be in heaven instead of earth, Let heaven look to it, I am not afraid, She seized my hands with both hers, strained them fast, And drew her probing and unscrupulous eyes Right through me, body and heart. Yet, foolish Sweet, You love this man. I have watched you when he came, And when he went, and when weve talked of him: I am not old for nothing; I can tell The weather-signs of love—you love this man. Girls blush, sometimes, because they are alive, Half wishing they were dead to save the shame. The sudden blush devours them, neck and brow; They have drawn too near the fire of life, like gnats, And flare up bodily, wings and all. What then? Whos sorry for a gnat,or girl? I blushed. I feel the brand upon my forehead now Strike hot, sear deep, as guiltless men may feel The felons iron, say, and scorn the mark Of what they are not. Most illogical Irrational nature of our womanhood, That blushes one way, feels another way, And prays, perhaps, another! After all, We cannot be the equal of the male, Who rules his blood a little. For although I blushed indeed, as if I loved the man, And her incisive smile, accrediting That treason of false witness in my blush, Did bow me downward like a swathe of grass Below its level that struck me, I attest The conscious skies and all their daily suns, I think I loved him not,nor then, nor since  Nor ever. Do we love the schoolmaster, Being busy in the woods? much less, being poor, The overseer of the parish? Do we keep Our love, to pay our debts with? White and cold I grew next moment. As my blood recoiled From that imputed ignominy, I made My heart great with it. Then, at last, I spoke, Spoke veritable words, but passionate, Too passionate perhaps,ground up with sobs To shapeless endings. She let fall my hands, And took her smile off, in sedate disgust, As peradventure she had touched a snake, A dead snake, mind!—and, turning round, replied, Well leave Italian manners, if you please. I think you had an English father, child, And ought to find it possible to speak A quiet yes or no, like English girls, Without convulsions. In another month Well take another answer,no, or yes. With that, she left me in the garden-walk. I had a father! yes, but long ago— How long it seemed that moment. Oh, how far, How far and safe, God, dost thou keep thy saints When once gone from us! We may call against The lighted windows of thy fair June-heaven Where all the souls are happy, and not one, Not even my father, look from work or play To ask, Who is it that cries after us, Below there, in the dusk? Yet formerly He turned his face upon me quick enough, If I said father. Now I might cry loud; The little lark reached higher with his song Than I with crying. Oh, alone, alone, Not troubling any in heaven, nor any on earth, I stood there in the garden, and looked up The deaf blue sky that brings the roses out On such June mornings. You who keep account Of crisis and transition in this life, Set down the first time Nature says plain no To some yes in you, and walks over you In gorgeous sweeps of scorn. We all begin By singing with the birds, and running fast With June-days, hand in hand: but once, for all, The birds must sing against us, and the sun Strike down upon us like a friends sword caught By an enemy to slay us, while we read The dear name on the blade which bites at us!— Thats bitter and convincing: after that, We seldom doubt that something in the large Smooth order of creation, though no more Than haply a mans footstep, has gone wrong. Some tears fell down my cheeks, and then I smiled, As those smile who have no face in the world To smile back to them. I had lost a friend In Romney Leigh; the thing was sure—a friend, Who had looked at me most gently now and then, And spoken of my favourite books,our books,With such a voice! Well, voice and look were now More utterly shut out from me, I felt, Than even my fathers. Romney now was turned To a benefactor, to a generous man, Who had tied himself to marry,me, instead Of such a woman, with low timorous lids He lifted with a sudden word one day, And left, perhaps, for my sake.—Ah, self-tied By a contract, male Iphigenia, bound At a fatal Aulis, for the winds to change, But loose him—theyll not change; he well might seem A little cold and dominant in love! He had a right to be dogmatical, This poor, good Romney. Love, to him, was made A simple law-clause. If I married him, I would not dare to call my soul my own, Which so he had bought and paid for: every thought And every heart-beat down there in the bill, Not one found honestly deductible From any use that pleased him! He might cut My body into coins to give away Among his other paupers; change my sons, While I stood dumb as Griseld, for black babes Or piteous foundlings; might unquestioned set My right hand teaching in the Ragged Schools, My left hand washing in the Public Baths, What time my angel of the Ideal stretched Both his to me in vain! I could not claim The poor right of a mouse in a trap, to squeal, And take so much as pity, from myself. Farewell, good Romney! if I loved you even, I could but ill afford to let you be So generous to me. Farewell, friend, since friend Betwixt us two, forsooth, must be a word So heavily overladen. And, since help Must come to me from those who love me not, Farewell, all helpers—I must help myself, And am alone from henceforth.—Then I stooped, And lifted the soiled garland from the ground, And set it on my head as bitterly As when the Spanish king did crown the bones Of his dead love. So be it. I preserve That crown still, in the drawer there! twas the first; The rest are like it;—those Olympian crowns, We run for, till we lose sight of the sun In the dust of the racing chariots! After that, Before the evening fell, I had a note Which ran, Aurora, sweet Chaldean, you read My meaning backward like your eastern books, While I am from the west, dear. Read me now A little plainer. Did you hate me quite But yesterday? I loved you for my part; I love you. If I spoke untenderly This morning, my beloved, pardon it; And comprehend me that I loved you so, I set you on the level of my soul, And overwashed you with the bitter brine Of some habitual thoughts. Henceforth, my flower, Be planted out of reach of any such, And lean the side you please, with all your leaves! Write womans verses and dream womans dreams; But let me feel your perfume in my home, To make my sabbath after working-days; Bloom out your youth beside me, be my wife. I wrote in answer—We, Chaldeans, discern Still farther than we read. I know your heart, And shut it like the holy book it is, Reserved for mild-eyed saints to pore upon Betwixt their prayers at vespers. Well, youre right, I did not surely hate you yesterday; And yet I do not love you enough to-day To wed you, cousin Romney. Take this word, And let it stop you as a generous man From speaking farther. You may tease, indeed, And blow about my feelings, or my leaves, And heres my aunt will help you with east winds, And break a stalk, perhaps, tormenting me; But certain flowers grow near as deep as trees, And, cousin, youll not move my root, not you, With all your confluent storms. Then let me grow Within my wayside hedge, and pass your way! This flower has never as much to say to you As the antique tomb which said to travellers, Pause, Siste, viator. Ending thus, I signed. The next week passed in silence, so the next, And several after: Romney did not come, Nor my aunt chide me. I lived on and on, As if my heart were kept beneath a glass, And everybody stood, all eyes and ears, To see and hear it tick. I could not sit, Nor walk, nor take a book, nor lay it down, Not sew on steadily, nor drop a stitch And a sigh with it, but I felt her looks Still cleaving to me, like the sucking asp To Cleopatras breast, persistently Through the intermittent pantings. Being observed, When observation is not sympathy, Is just being tortured. If she said a word, A thank you, or an if it please you, dear, She meant a commination, or, at best, An exorcism against the devildom Which plainly held me. So with all the house. Susannah could not stand and twist my hair, Without such glancing at the looking-glass To see my face there, that she missed the plait: And John, I never sent my plate for soup, Or did not send it, but the foolish John Resolved the problem, twixt his napkined thumbs, Of what was signified by taking soup Or choosing mackerel. Neighbours, who dropped in On morning visits, feeling a joint wrong, Smiled admonition, sate uneasily, And talked with measured, emphasised reserve, Of parish news, like doctors to the sick, When not called in, as if, with leave to speak, They might say something. Nay, the very dog Would watch me from his sun-patch on the floor, In alternation with the large black fly Not yet in reach of snapping. So I lived. A Roman died so; smeared with honey, teased By insects, stared to torture by the noon: And many patient souls neath English roofs Have died like Romans. I, in looking back, Wish only, now, I had borne the plague of all With meeker spirits than were rife in Rome. For, on the sixth week, the dead sea broke up, Dashed suddenly through beneath the heel of Him Who stands upon the sea and earth, and swears Time shall be nevermore. The clock struck nine That morning, too, no lark was out of tune; The hidden farms among the hills, breathed straight Their smoke toward heaven; the lime-tree scarcely stirred Beneath the blue weight of the cloudless sky, Though still the July air came floating through The woodbine at my window, in and out, With touches of the out-door country-news For a bending forehead. There I sate, and wished That morning-truce of God would last till eve, Or longer. Sleep, I thought, late sleepers, sleep, And spare me yet, the burden of your eyes. Then, suddenly, a single ghastly shriek Tore upwards from the bottom of the house. Like one who wakens in a grave and shrieks, The still house seemed to shriek itself alive, And shudder through its passages and stairs With slam of doors and clash of bells.—I sprang, I stood up in the middle of the room, And there confronted at my chamber-door, A white face, shivering, ineffectual lips. Come, come, they tried to utter, and I went; As if a ghost had drawn me at the point Of a fiery finger through the uneven dark, I went with reeling footsteps down the stair, Nor asked a question. There she sate, my aunt, Bolt upright in the chair beside her bed, Whose pillow had no dint! she had used no bed For that nights sleeping,yet slept well. My God, The dumb derision of that grey, peaked face Concluded something grave against the sun, Which filled the chamber with its July burst When Susan drew the curtains, ignorant Of who sate open-eyed behind her. There, She sate,it sate,we said she yesterday,And held a letter with unbroken seal, As Susan gave it to her hand last night: All night she had held it. If its news referred To duchies or to dunghills, not an inch Shed budge, twas obvious, for such worthless odds: Nor, though the stars were suns, and overburned Their spheric limitations, swallowing up Like wax the azure spaces, could they force Those open eyes to wink once. What last sight Had left them blank and flat so, drawing out The faculty of vision from the roots, As nothing more, worth seeing, remained behind? Were those the eyes that watched me, worried me? That dogged me up and down the hours and days, A beaten, breathless, miserable soul? And did I pray, a half hour back, but so, To escape the burden of those eyes,those eyes? Sleep late I said.— Why now, indeed, they sleep. God answers sharp and sudden on some prayers, And thrusts the thing we have prayed for in our face, A gauntlet with a gift int. Every wish Is like a prayer,with God. I had my wish, To read and meditate the thing I would, To fashion all my life upon my thought, And marry, or not marry. Henceforth, none Could disapprove me, vex me, hamper me. Full ground-room, in this desert newly made, For Babylon or Balbec, when the breath, Just choked with sand, returns, for building towns! The heir came over on the funeral day, And we two cousins met before the dead, With two pale faces. Was it death or life That moved us? When the will was read and done, The official guest and witnesses withdrawn, We rose up in a silence almost hard, And looked at one another. Then I said, Farewell, my cousin. But he touched, just touched My hatstrings tied for going, at the door The carriage stood to take me and said low, His voice a little unsteady through his smile, Siste, viator. Is there time, I asked, In these last days of railroads, to stop short Like Cæsars chariot weighing half a ton On the Appian road, for morals? There is time, He answered grave, for necessary words, Inclusive, trust me, of no epitaph On man or act, my cousin. We have read A will, which gives you all the personal goods And funded monies of your aunt. I thank Her memory for it. With three hundred pounds We buy in England even, clear standing-room To stand and work in. Only two hours since, I fancied I was poor. And, cousin, still Youre richer than you fancy. The will says, Three hundred pounds, and any other sum Of which the said testatrix dies possessed. I say she died possessed of other sums. Dear Romney, need we chronicle the pence? I'm richer than I thought—thats evident. Enough so. Listen rather. Youve to do With business and a cousin, he resumed, And both, I fear, need patience. Heres the fact. The other sum there is another sum, Unspecified in any will which dates After possession, yet bequeathed as much And clearly as those said three hundred pounds Is thirty thousand. You will have it paid When? where? My duty troubles you with words. He struck the iron when the bar was hot; No wonder if my eyes sent out some sparks. Pause there! I thank you. You are delicate In glosing gifts;—but I, who share your blood, Am rather made for giving, like yourself, Than taking, like your pensioners. Farewell. He stopped me with a gesture of calm pride. A Leigh, he said, gives largesse and gives love, But gloses neither: if a Leigh could glose, He would not do it, moreover, to a Leigh, With blood trained up along nine centuries To hound and hate a lie, from eyes like yours. And now well make the rest as clear; your aunt Possessed these monies. You will make it clear, My cousin, as the honour of us both, Or one of us speaks vainly—thats not I. My aunt possessed this sum, inherited From whom, and when? bring documents, prove dates. Why now indeed you throw your bonnet off, As if you had time left for a logarithm! The faiths the want. Dear cousin, give me faith, And you shall walk this road with silken shoes, As clean as any lady of our house Supposed the proudest. Oh, I comprehend The whole position from your point of sight. I oust you from your fathers halls and lands, And make you poor by getting rich—thats law; Considering which, in common circumstance, You would not scruple to accept from me Some compensation, some sufficiency Of income—that were justice; but, alas, I love you,thats mere nature!—you reject My love,thats nature also;—and at once, You cannot, from a suitor disallowed, A hand thrown back as mine is, into yours Receive a doit, a farthing,not for the world! Thats etiquette with women, obviously Exceeding claim of nature, law, and right, Unanswerable to all. I grant, you see, The case as you conceive it, leave you room To sweep your ample skirts of womanhood; While, standing humbly squeezed against the wall, I own myself excluded from being just, Restrained from paying indubitable debts, Because denied from giving you my soul— Thats my misfortune!—I submit to it As if, in some more reasonable age, Twould not be less inevitable. Enough. Youll trust me, cousin, as a gentleman, To keep your honour, as you count it, pure, Your scruples just as if I thought them wise Safe and inviolate from gifts of mine. I answered mild but earnest. I believe In no ones honour which another keeps, Nor mans nor womans. As I keep, myself, My truth and my religion, I depute No father, though I had one this side death, Nor brother, though I had twenty, much less you, Though twice my cousin, and once Romney Leigh, To keep my honour pure. You face, to-day, A man who wants instruction, mark me, not A woman who wants protection. As to a man, Show manhood, speak out plainly, be precise With facts and dates. My aunt inherited This sum, you say— I said she died possessed Of this, dear cousin. Not by heritage. Thank you: were getting to the facts at last. Perhaps she played at commerce with a ship Which came in heavy with Australian gold? Or touched a lottery with her finger-end, Which tumbled on a sudden into her lap Some old Rhine tower or principality? Perhaps she had to do with a marine Sub-transatlantic railroad, which pre-pays As well as pre-supposes? or perhaps Some stale ancestral debt was after-paid By a hundred years, and took her by surprise?— You shake your head my cousin; I guess ill. You need not guess, Aurora, nor deride, The truth is not afraid of hurting you. Youll find no cause, in all your scruples, why Your aunt should cavil at a deed of gift Twixt her and me. I thought so—ah! a gift. You naturally thought so, he resumed. A very natural gift. A gift, a gift! Her individual life being stranded high Above all want, approaching opulence, Too haughty was she to accept a gift Without some ultimate aim: ah, ah, I see, A gift intended plainly for her heirs, And so accepted,if accepted,ah, Indeed that might be; I am snared perhaps, Just so. But, cousin, shall I pardon you, If thus you have caught me with a cruel springe? He answered gently, Need you tremble and pant Like a netted lioness? ist my fault, mine, That youre a grand wild creature of the woods, And hate the stall built for you? Any way, Though triply netted, need you glare at me? I do not hold the cords of such a net; Youre free from me, Aurora! Now may God Deliver me from this strait! This gift of yours Was tendered,when? accepted,when? I asked. A month,a fortnight since? Six weeks ago It was not tendered. By a word she dropped, I know it was not tendered nor received. When was it? bring your dates. What matters when? A half-hour ere she died, or a half-year, Secured the gift, maintains the heritage Inviolable with law. As easy pluck The golden stars from heavens embroidered stole, To pin them on the grey side of this earth, As make you poor again, thank God. Not poor Nor clean again from henceforth, you thank God? Well, sir—I ask you,I insist at need,Vouchsafe the special date, the special date. The day before her death-day, he replied, The gift was in her hands. Well find that deed, And certify that date to you. As one Who has climbed a mountain-height and carried up His own heart climbing, panting in his throat With the toil of the ascent, takes breath at last, Looks back in triumph—so I stood and looked: Dear cousin Romney, we have reached the top Of this steep question, and may rest, I think. But first, I pray you pardon, that the shock And surge of natural feeling and event Had made me oblivious of acquainting you That this, this letter,unread, mark, still sealed, Was found enfolded in the poor dead hand: That spirit of hers had gone beyond the address, Which could not find her though you wrote it clear, I know your writing, Romney, recognise The open-hearted A, the liberal sweep Of the G. Now listen, let us understand; You will not find that famous deed of gift, Unless you find it in the letter here, Which, not being mine, I give you back.—Refuse To take the letter? well then—you and I, As writer and as heiress, open it Together, by your leave.—Exactly so: The words in which the noble offerings made, Are nobler still, my cousin; and, I own, The proudest and most delicate heart alive, Distracted from the measure of the gift By such a grace in giving, might accept Your largesse without thinking any more Of the burthen of it, than King Solomon Considered, when he wore his holy ring Charáctered over with the ineffable spell, How many carats of fine gold made up Its money-value. So, Leigh gives to Leigh— Or rather, might have given, observe!—for thats The point we come to. Heres a proof of gift, But heres no proof, sir, of acceptancy, But rather, disproof. Deaths black dust, being blown, Infiltrated through every secret fold Of this sealed letter by a puff of fate, Dried up for ever the fresh-written ink, Annulled the gift, disutilised the grace, And left these fragments. As I spoke, I tore The paper up and down, and down and up And crosswise, till it fluttered from my hands, As forest-leaves, stripped suddenly and rapt By a whirlwind on Valdarno, drop again, Drop slow, and strew the melancholy ground Before the amazèd hills,why, so, indeed, I'm writing like a poet, somewhat large In the type of the image, and exaggerate A small thing with a great thing, topping it!— But then I'm thinking how his eyes looked,his, With what despondent and surprised reproach! I think the tears were in them, as he looked— I think the manly mouth just trembled. Then He broke the silence. I may ask, perhaps, Although no stranger,only Romney Leigh, Which means still less,than Vincent Carrington,Your plans in going hence, and where you go. This cannot be a secret. All my life Is open to you, cousin. I go hence To London, to the gathering-place of souls, To live mine straight out, vocally, in books; Harmoniously for others, if indeed A womans soul, like mans, be wide enough To carry the whole octave thats to prove Or, if I fail, still, purely for myself. Pray God be with me, Romney. Ah, poor child, Who fight against the mothers tiring hand, And choose the headsmans! May God change his world For your sake, sweet, and make it mild as heaven, And juster than I have found you! But I paused. And you, my cousin?— I, he said, you ask? You care to ask? Well, girls have curious minds, And fain would know the end of everything, Of cousins, therefore, with the rest. For me, Aurora, Ive my work; you know my work; And, having missed this year some personal hope, I must beware the rather that I miss No reasonable duty. While you sing Your happy pastorals of the meads and trees, Bethink you that I go to impress and prove On stifled brains and deafened ears, stunned deaf, Crushed dull with grief, that nature sings itself, And needs no mediate poet, lute or voice, To make it vocal. While you ask of men Your audience, I may get their leave perhaps For hungry orphans to say audibly Were hungry, see, for beaten and bullied wives To hold their unweaned babies up in sight, Whom orphanage would better; and for all To speak and claim their portion,by no means Of the soil,but of the sweat in tilling it, Since this is now-a-days turned privilege, To have only Gods curse on us, and not mans. Such work I have for doing, elbow-deep In social problems, as you tie your rhymes, To draw my uses to cohere with needs, And bring the uneven world back to its round; Or, failing so much, fill up, bridge at least To smoother issues, some abysmal cracks And feuds of earth, intestine heats have made To keep men separate, using sorry shifts Of hospitals, almshouses, infant schools, And other practical stuff of partial good, You lovers of the beautiful and whole, Despise by system. I despise? The scorn Is yours, my cousin. Poets become such, Through scorning nothing. You decry them for The good of beauty, sung and taught by them, While they respect your practical partial good As being a part of beautys self. Adieu! When God helps all the workers for his world, The singers shall have help of Him, not last. He smiled as men smile when they will not speak Because of something bitter in the thought; And still I feel his melancholy eyes Look judgment on me. It is seven years since: I know not if twas pity or twas scorn Has made them so far-reaching: judge it ye Who have had to do with pity more than love. And scorn than hatred. I am used, since then, To other ways, from equal men. But so, Even so, we let go hands, my cousin and I, And, in between us, rushed the torrent-world To blanch our faces like divided rocks, And bar for ever mutual sight and touch Except through swirl of spray and all that roar. THIRD BOOK. To-day thou girdest up thy loins thyself, And goest where thou wouldest: presently Others shall gird thee, said the Lord, to go Where thou wouldst not. He spoke to Peter thus, To signify the death which he should die When crucified head downwards. If He spoke To Peter then, He speaks to us the same; The word suits many different martyrdoms, And signifies a multiform of death, Although we scarcely die apostles, we, And have mislaid the keys of heaven and earth. For tis not in mere death that men die most; And, after our first girding of the loins In youths fine linen and fair broidery, To run up hill and meet the rising sun, We are apt to sit tired, patient as a fool, While others gird us with the violent bands Of social figments, feints, and formalisms, Reversing our straight nature, lifting up Our base needs, keeping down our lofty thoughts, Head downward on the cross-sticks of the world. Yet He can pluck us from that shameful cross. God, set our feet low and our forehead high, And show us how a man was made to walk! Leave the lamp, Susan, and go up to bed. The room does very well; I have to write Beyond the stroke of midnight. Get away; Your steps, for ever buzzing in the room, Tease me like gnats. Ah, letters! throw them down At once, as I must have them, to be sure, Whether I bid you never bring me such At such an hour, or bid you. No excuse. You choose to bring them, as I choose perhaps To throw them in the fire. Now, get to bed, And dream, if possible, I am not cross. Why what a pettish, petty thing I grow, A mere, mere woman, a mere flaccid nerve, A kerchief left out all night in the rain, Turned soft so, overtasked and overstrained And overlived in this close London life! And yet I should be stronger. Never burn Your letters, poor Aurora! for they stare With red seals from the table, saying each, Heres something that you know not. Out alas, Tis scarcely that the worlds more good and wise Or even straighter and more consequent Since yesterday at this time—yet, again, If but one angel spoke from Ararat, I should be very sorry not to hear: So open all the letters! let me read. Blanche Ord, the writer in the Ladys Fan, Requests my judgment on,that, afterwards. Kate Ward desires the model of my cloak, And signs, Elisha to you. Pringle Sharpe Presents his work on Social Conduct,craves A little money for his pressing debts,From me, who scarce have money for my needs, Arts fiery chariot which we journey in Being apt to singe our singing-robes to holes, Although you ask me for my cloak, Kate Ward! Heres Rudgely knows it, editor and scribe— Hes forced to marry where his heart is not, Because the purse lacks where he lost his heart. Ah, — lost it because no one picked it up! Thats really loss! and passable impudence. My critic Hammond flatters prettily, And wants another volume like the last. My critic Belfair wants another book Entirely different, which will sell, and live? A striking book, yet not a startling book, The public blames originalities, You must not pump spring-water unawares Upon a gracious public, full of nerves— Good things, not subtle, new yet orthodox, As easy reading as the dog-eared page Thats fingered by said public, fifty years, Since first taught spelling by its grandmother, And yet a revelation in some sort: Thats hard, my critic Belfair! So—what next? My critic Stokes objects to abstract thoughts; Call a man, John, a woman, Joan, says he, And do not prate so of humanities: Whereat I call my critic, simply Stokes. My critic Jobson recommends more mirth, Because a cheerful genius suits the times, And all true poets laugh unquenchably Like Shakspeare and the gods. Thats very hard. The gods may laugh, and Shakspeare; Dante smiled With such a needy heart on two pale lips, We cry, Weep rather, Dante. Poems are Men, if true poems: and who dares exclaim At any mans door, Here, tis probable The thunder fell last week, and killed a wife, And scared a sickly husband—what of that? Get up, be merry, shout, and clap your hands, Because a cheerful genius suits the times—? None says so to the man, and why indeed Should any to the poem? A ninth seal; The apocalypse is drawing to a close. Ha, this from Vincent Carrington, Dear friend, I want good counsel. Will you lend me wings To raise me to the subject, in a sketch Ill bring to-morrow—may I? at eleven? A poets only born to turn to use; So save you! for the world,and Carrington. Writ after. Have you heard of Romney Leigh, Beyond whats said of him in newspapers, His phalansteries there, his speeches here, His pamphlets, pleas, and statements, everywhere? He dropped me long ago; but no one drops A golden apple—though indeed, one day, You hinted that, but jested. Well, at least, You know Lord Howe, who sees him,whom he sees, And you see, and I hate to see, for Howe Stands high upon the brink of theories, Observes the swimmers, and cries Very fine, But keeps dry linen equally, unlike That gallant breaster, Romney. Strange it is, Such sudden madness seizing a young man, To make earth over again, while I'm content To make the pictures. Let me bring the sketch. A tiptoe Danae, overbold and hot; Both arms a-flame to meet her wishing Jove Halfway, and burn him faster down; the face And breasts upturned and straining, the loose locks All glowing with the anticipated gold. Or heres another on the self-same theme. She lies here—flat upon her prison-floor, The long hair swathed about her to the heel, Like wet sea-weed. You dimly see her through The glittering haze of that prodigious rain, Half blotted out of nature by a love As heavy as fate. Ill bring you either sketch. I think, myself, the second indicates More passion. Surely. Self is put away, And calm with abdication. She is Jove, And no more Danae—greater thus. Perhaps The painter symbolises unawares Two states of the recipient artist-soul; One, forward, personal, wanting reverence, Because aspiring only. Well be calm, And know that, when indeed our Joves come down, We all turn stiller than we have ever been. Kind Vincent Carrington. Ill let him come. He talks of Florence, and may say a word Of something as it chanced seven years ago, A hedgehog in the path, or a lame bird, In those green country walks, in that good time, When certainly I was so miserable,I seem to have missed a blessing ever since. The music soars within the little lark, And the lark soars. It is not thus with men. We do not make our places with our strains, Content, while they rise, to remain behind, Alone on earth instead of so in heaven. No matter—I bear on my broken tale. When Romney Leigh and I had parted thus, I took a chamber up three flights of stairs Not far from being as steep as some larks climb, And, in a certain house in Kensington, Three years I lived and worked. Get leave to work In this world, tis the best you get at all; For God, in cursing, gives us better gifts Than men in benediction. God says, Sweat For foreheads; men say crowns; and so we are crowned, Ay, gashed by some tormenting circle of steel Which snaps with a secret spring. Get work, get work; Be sure tis better than what you work to get. So, happy and unafraid of solitude, I worked the short days out, and watched the sun On lurid morns or monstrous afternoons, Like some Druidic idols fiery brass, With fixed unflickering outline of dead heat, In which the blood of wretches pent inside Seemed oozing forth to incarnadine the air, Push out through fog with his dilated disk, And startle the slant roofs and chimney-pots With splashes of fierce colour. Or I saw Fog only, the great tawny weltering fog, Involve the passive city, strangle it Alive, and draw it off into the void, Spires, bridges, streets, and squares, as if a spunge Had wiped out London, or as noon and night Had clapped together and utterly struck out The intermediate time, undoing themselves In the act. Your city poets see such things, Not despicable. Mountains of the south, When, drunk and mad with elemental wines, They rend the seamless mist and stand up bare, Make fewer singers, haply. No one sings, Descending Sinai: on Parnassus mount, You take a mule to climb, and not a muse, Except in fable and figure: forests chant Their anthems to themselves, and leave you dumb. But sit in London, at the days decline, And view the city perish in the mist Like Pharaohs armaments in the deep Red Sea, The chariots, horsemen, footmen, all the host, Sucked down and choked to silence—then, surprised By a sudden sense of vision and of tune, You feel as conquerors though you did not fight, And you and Israels other singing girls, Ay, Miriam with them, sing the song you choose. I worked with patience which means almost power. I did some excellent things indifferently, Some bad things excellently. Both were praised, The latter loudest. And by such a time That I myself had set them down as sins Scarce worth the price of sackcloth, week by week, Arrived some letter through the sedulous post, Like these Ive read, and yet dissimilar, With pretty maiden seals, initials twined Of lilies, or a heart marked Emily, Convicting Emily of being all heart; Or rarer tokens from young bachelors, Who wrote from college with the same goosequill, Suppose, they had just been plucked of and a snatch From Horace, Collegisse juvat, set Upon the first page. Many a letter signed Or unsigned, showing the writers at eighteen Had lived too long, though every muse should help The daylight, holding candles, compliments, To smile or sigh at. Such could pass with me No more than coins from Moscow circulate At Paris. Would ten roubles buy a tag Of ribbon on the boulevard, worth a sou? I smiled that all this youth should love me, sighed That such a love could scarcely raise them up To love what was more worthy than myself; Then sighed again, again, less generously, To think the very love they lavished so, Proved me inferior. The strong loved me not, And he,my cousin Romney,did not write. I felt the silent finger of his scorn Prick every bubble of my frivolous fame As my breath blew it, and resolve it back To the air it came from. Oh, I justified The measure he had taken of my height: The thing was plain—he was not wrong a line; I played at art, made thrusts with a toy-sword, Amused the lads and maidens. Came a sigh Deep, hoarse with resolution, I would work To better ends, or play in earnest. Heavens, I think I should be almost popular If this went on!—I ripped my verses up, And found no blood upon the rapiers point; The heart in them was just an embryos heart, Which never yet had beat, that it should die; Just gasps of make-believe galvanic life; Mere tones, inorganised to any tune. And yet I felt it in me where it burnt, Like those hot fire-seeds of creation held In Joves clenched palm before the worlds were sown, But I—I was not Juno even! my hand Was shut in weak convulsion, womans ill, And when I yearned to loose a finger—lo, The nerve revolted. Tis the same even now: This hand may never, haply, open large, Before the spark is quenched, or the palm charred, To prove the power not else than by the pain. It burns, it burnt—my whole life burnt with it, And light, not sunlight and not torchlight, flashed My steps out through the slow and difficult road. I had grown distrustful of too forward Springs, The seasons books in drear significance Of morals, dropping round me. Lively books? The ash has livelier verdure than the yew; And yet the yews green longer, and alone Found worthy of the holy Christmas time. Well plant more yews if possible, albeit We plant the graveyards with them. Day and night I worked my rhythmic thought, and furrowed up Both watch and slumber with long lines of life Which did not suit their season. The rose fell From either cheek, my eyes globed luminous Through orbits of blue shadow, and my pulse Would shudder along the purple-veined wrist Like a shot bird. Youths stern, set face to face With youths ideal: and when people came And said, You work too much, you are looking ill, I smiled for pity of them who pitied me, And thought I should be better soon perhaps For those ill looks. Observe—I, means in youth Just I,the conscious and eternal soul With all its ends, and not the outside life, The parcel-man, the doublet of the flesh, The so much liver, lung, integument, Which make the sum of I hereafter, when World-talkers talk of doing well or ill. I prosper, if I gain a step, although A nail then pierced my foot: although my brain Embracing any truth, froze paralysed, I prosper. I but change my instrument; I break the spade off, digging deep for gold, And catch the mattock up. I worked on, on. Through all the bristling fence of nights and days Which hedges time in from the eternities, I struggled,never stopped to note the stakes Which hurt me in my course. The midnight oil Would stink sometimes; there came some vulgar needs: I had to live, that therefore I might work, And, being but poor, I was constrained, for life, To work with one hand for the booksellers, While working with the other for myself And art. You swim with feet as well as hands, Or make small way. I apprehended this, In England, no one lives by verse that lives; And, apprehending, I resolved by prose To make a space to sphere my living verse. I wrote for cyclopædias, magazines, And weekly papers, holding up my name To keep it from the mud. I learnt the use Of the editorial we in a review, As courtly ladies the fine trick of trains, And swept it grandly through the open doors As if one could not pass through doors at all Save so encumbered. I wrote tales beside, Carved many an article on cherry-stones To suit light readers, something in the lines Revealing, it was said, the mallet-hand, But that, Ill never vouch for. What you do For bread, will taste of common grain, not grapes, Although you have a vineyard in Champagne, Much less in Nephelococcygia, As mine was, peradventure. Having bread For just so many days, just breathing room For body and verse, I stood up straight and worked My veritable work. And as the soul Which grows within a child, makes the child grow, Or as the fiery sap, the touch from God, Careering through a tree, dilates the bark, And roughs with scale and knob, before it strikes The summer foliage out in a green flame— So life, in deepening with me, deepened all The course I took, the work I did. Indeed, The academic law convinced of sin; The critics cried out on the falling off, Regretting the first manner. But I felt My hearts life throbbing in my verse to show It lived, it also—certes incomplete, Disordered with all Adam in the blood, But even its very tumours, warts, and wens, Still organised by, and implying life. A lady called upon me on such a day. She had the low voice of your English dames, Unused, it seems, to need rise half a note To catch attention, and their quiet mood, As if they lived too high above the earth For that to put them out in anything: So gentle, because verily so proud; So wary and afeared of hurting you, By no means that you are not really vile, But that they would not touch you with their foot To push you to your place; so self-possessed Yet gracious and conciliating, it takes An effort in their presence to speak truth: You know the sort of woman, brilliant stuff, And out of nature. Lady Waldemar, She said her name quite simply, as if it meant Not much indeed, but something, took my hands, And smiled, as if her smile could help my case, And dropped her eyes on me, and let them melt. Is this, she said, the Muse? No sybil even, I answered, since she fails to guess the cause Which taxed you with this visit, madam. Good, She said, I like to be sincere at once; Perhaps, if I had found a literal Muse, The visit might have taxed me. As it is, You wear your blue so chiefly in your eyes, My fair Aurora, in a frank good way, It comforts me entirely for your fame, As well as for the trouble of my ascent To this Olympus. There, a silver laugh Ran rippling through her quickened little breaths The steep stair somewhat justified. But still Your ladyship has left me curious why You dared the risk of finding the said Muse? Ah, keep me, notwithstanding, to the point, Like any pedant. Is the blue in eyes As awful as in stockings, after all, I wonder, that youd have my business out Before I breathe—exact the epic plunge In spite of gasps? Well, naturally you think Ive come here, as the lion-hunters go To deserts, to secure you, with a trap, For exhibition in my drawing-rooms On zoologic soirées? Not in the least. Roar softly at me; I am frivolous, I dare say; I have played at lions, too, Like other women of my class, but now I meet my lion simply as Androcles Met his,when at his mercy. So, she bent Her head, as queens may mock, then lifting up Her eyelids with a real grave queenly look, Which ruled, and would not spare, not even herself, I think you have a cousin:—Romney Leigh. You bring a word from him?—my eyes leapt up To the very height of hers, a word from him? I bring a word about him, actually. But first, she pressed me with her urgent eyes— You do not love him, you? Youre frank at least In putting questions, madam, I replied. I love my cousin cousinly—no more. I guessed as much. I'm ready to be frank In answering also, if youll question me, Or even with something less. You stand outside, You artist women, of the common sex; You share not with us, and exceed us so Perhaps by what youre mulcted in, your hearts Being starved to make your heads: so run the old Traditions of you. I can therefore speak, Without the natural shame which creatures feel When speaking on their level, to their like. Theres many a papist she, would rather die Than own to her maid she put a ribbon on To catch the indifferent eye of such a man, Who yet would count adulteries on her beads At holy Marys shrine, and never blush; Because the saints are so far off, we lose All modesty before them. Thus, today. Tis I, love Romney Leigh. Forbear, I cried. If heres no Muse, still less is any saint; Nor even a friend, that Lady Waldemar Should make confessions  Thats unkindly said. If no friend, what forbids to make a friend To join to our confession ere we have done? I love your cousin. If it seems unwise To say so, its still foolisher were frank To feel so. My first husband left me young, And pretty enough, so please you, and rich enough, To keep my booth in May-fair with the rest To happy issues. There are marquises Would serve seven years to call me wife, I know: And, after seven, I might consider it, For theres some comfort in a marquisate When alls said, yes, but after the seven years; I, now, love Romney. You put up your lip, So like a Leigh! so like him!—Pardon me, I am well aware I do not derogate In loving Romney Leigh. The name is good, The means are excellent; but the man, the man— Heaven help us both, I am near as mad as he, In loving such an one. She slowly swung Her heavy ringlets till they touched her smile, As reasonably sorry for herself; And thus continued, Of a truth, Miss Leigh, I have not, without struggle, come to this. I took a master in the German tongue, I gamed a little, went to Paris twice; But, after all, this love!. you eat of love, And do as vile a thing as if you ate Of garlic—which, whatever else you eat, Tastes uniformly acrid, till your peach Reminds you of your onion. Am I coarse? Well, loves coarse, natures coarse—ah, theres the rub! We fair fine ladies, who park out our lives From common sheep-paths, cannot help the crows From flying over, were as natural still As Blowsalinda. Drape us perfectly In Lyons velvet, we are not, for that, Lay-figures, look you! we have hearts within, Warm, live, improvident, indecent hearts, As ready for distracted ends and acts As any distressed sempstress of them all That Romney groans and toils for. We catch love And other fevers, in the vulgar way. Love will not be outwitted by our wit, Nor outrun by our equipages:—mine Persisted, spite of efforts. All my cards Turned up but Romney Leigh; my German stopped At germane Wertherism; my Paris rounds Returned me from the Champs Elysées just A ghost, and sighing like Didos. I came home Uncured, convicted rather to myself Of being in love,in love! Thats coarse youll say. I'm talking garlic. Coldly I replied. Apologise for atheism, not love! For me, I do believe in love, and God. I know my cousin: Lady Waldemar I know not: yet I say as much as this— Whoever loves him, let her not excuse But cleanse herself, that, loving such a man, She may not do it with such unworthy love He cannot stoop and take it. That is said Austerely, like a youthful prophetess, Who knits her brows across her pretty eyes To keep them back from following the grey flight Of doves between the temple-columns. Dear, Be kinder with me. Let us two be friends. I'm a mere woman, the more weak perhaps Through being so proud; youre better; as for him, Hes best. Indeed he builds his goodness up So high, it topples down to the other side, And makes a sort of badness; theres the worst I have to say against your cousins best! And so be mild, Aurora, with my worst, For his sake, if not mine. I own myself Incredulous of confidence like this Availing him or you. I, worthy of him? In your sense I am not so—let it pass. And yet I save him if I marry him; Let that pass too. Pass, pass! we play police Upon my cousins life, to indicate What may or may not pass? I cried. He knows Whats worthy of him; the choice remains with him; And what he chooses, act or wife, I think I shall not call unworthy, I, for one. Tis somewhat rashly said, she answered slow. Now lets talk reason, though we talk of love. Your cousin Romney Leighs a monster! there, The words out fairly; let me prove the fact. Well take, say, that most perfect of antiques, They call the Genius of the Vatican, Which seems too beauteous to endure itself In this mixed world, and fasten it for once Upon the torso of the Drunken Fawn, Who might limp surely, if he did not dance, Instead of Buonarrotis mask: what then? We show the sort of monster Romney is, With god-like virtues and heroic aims Subjoined to limping possibilities Of mismade human nature. Grant the man Twice god-like, twice heroic, still he limps, And heres the point we come to. Pardon me, But, Lady Waldemar, the points the thing We never come to. Caustic, insolent At need! I like you—there, she took my hands And now my lioness, help Androcles, For all your roaring. Help me! for myself I would not say so—but for him. He limps So certainly, hell fall into the pit A week hence, so I lose him—so he is lost! And when hes fairly married, he a Leigh, To a girl of doubtful life, undoubtful birth, Starved out in London, till her coarse-grained hands Are whiter than her morals, you, for one, May call his choice most worthy. Married! lost! He,Romney! Ah, youre moved at last, she said. These monsters, set out in the open sun, Of course throw monstrous shadows: those who think Awry, will scarce act straightly. Who but he? And who but you can wonder? He has been mad, The whole world knows, since first, a nominal man, He soured the proctors, tried the gownsmens wits, With equal scorn of triangles and wine, And took no honours, yet was honourable. Theyll tell you he lost count of Homers ships In Melbournes poor-bills, Ashleys factory bills, Ignored the Aspasia we all dare to praise, For other women, dear, we could not name Because were decent. Well, he had some right On his side probably; men always have, Who go absurdly wrong. The living boor Who brews your ale, exceeds in vital worth Dead Cæsar who stops bungholes in the cask; And also, to do good is excellent, For persons of his income, even to boors: I sympathise with all such things. But he Went mad upon them,madder and more mad, From college times to these, as, going down hill, The faster still, the farther! you must know Your Leigh by heart: he has sown his black young curls With bleaching cares of half a million men Already. If you do not starve, or sin, Youre nothing to him. Pay the income-tax, And break your heart upont,hell scarce be touched; But come upon the parish, qualified For the parish stocks, and Romney will be there To call you brother, sister, or perhaps A tenderer name still. Had I any chance With Mister Leigh, who am Lady Waldemar, And never committed felony? You speak Too bitterly, I said, for the literal truth. The truth is bitter. Heres a man who looks For ever on the ground! you must be low Or else a pictured ceiling overhead, Good painting thrown away. For me, Ive done What women may, were somewhat limited, We modest women but Ive done my best. —How men are perjured when they swear our eyes Have meaning in them! theyre just blue or brown, They just can drop their lids a little. In fact, Mine did more, for I read half Fourier through, Proudhon, Considerant, and Louis Blanc, With various others of his socialists; And if I had been a fathom less in love, Had cured myself with gaping. As it was, I quoted from them prettily enough, Perhaps, to make them sound half rational To a saner man than he, wheneer we talked, For which I dodged occasion—learnt by heart His speeches in the Commons and elsewhere Upon the social question; heaped reports Of wicked women and penitentiaries, On all my tables, with a place for Sue; And gave my name to swell subscription-lists Toward keeping up the sun at nights in heaven, And other possible ends. All things I did, Except the impossible,such as wearing gowns Provided by the Ten Hours movement! there, I stopped—we must stop somewhere. He, meanwhile, Unmoved as the Indian tortoise neath the world, Let all that noise go on upon his back: He would not disconcert or throw me out; Twas well to see a woman of my class With such a dawn of conscience. For the heart, Made firewood for his sake, and flaming up To his very face,he warmed his feet at it; But deigned to let my carriage stop him short In park or street, he leaning on the door, With news of the committee which sate last On pickpockets at suck. You jest—you jest. As martyrs jest, dear, if youve read their lives Upon the axe which kills them. When alls done By me,for him—youll ask him presently The colour of my hair—he cannot tell, Or answers dark at random, while, be sure, Hes absolute on the figure, five or ten, Of my last subscription. Is it bearable, And I a woman? Is it reparable, Though I were a man? I know not. Thats to prove. But, first, this shameful marriage. Ay? I cried, Then really theres a marriage? Yesterday I held him fast upon it. Mister Leigh, Said I, shut up a thing, it makes more noise. The boiling town keeps secrets ill; Ive known Yours since last week. Forgive my knowledge so: You feel I'm not the woman of the world The world thinks; you have borne with me before, And used me in your noble work, our work, And now you shall not cast me off because Youre at the difficult point, the join. Tis true Even I can scarce admit the cogency Of such a marriage,where you do not love, Except the class yet marry and throw your name Down to the gutter, for a fire-escape To future generations! its sublime, A great example, a true Genesis Of the opening social era. But take heed; This virtuous act must have a patent weight, Or loses half its virtue. Make it tell, Interpret it, and set in the light, And do not muffle it in a winter-cloak As a vulgar bit of shame, as if, at best, A Leigh had made a misalliance and blushed A Howard should know it. Then, I pressed him more— He would not choose, I said, that even his kin,Aurora Leigh, even,should conceive his act Less sacrifice, more appetite. At which He grew so pale, dear,to the lips, I knew I had touched him. Do you know her, he enquired, My cousin Aurora? Yes, I said, and lied, But truly we all know you by your books And so I offered to come straight to you, Explain the subject, justify the cause, And take you with me to St. Margarets Court To see this miracle, this Marian Erle, This drovers daughter shes not pretty, he swears Upon whose finger, exquisitely pricked By a hundred needles, were to hang the tie Twixt class and class in England, thus, indeed, By such a presence, yours and mine, to lift The match up from the doubtful place. At once He thanked me, sighing,murmured to himself, Shell do it perhaps; shes noble, thanked me twice, And promised, as my guerdon, to put off His marriage for a month. I answered then. I understand your drift imperfectly. You wish to lead me to my cousins betrothed, To touch her hand if worthy, and hold her hand If feeble, thus to justify his match. So be it then. But how this serves your ends, And how the strange confession of your love Serves this, I have to learn—I cannot see. She knit her restless forehead. Then, despite, Aurora, that most radiant morning name, Youre dull as any London afternoon. I wanted time, and gained it, wanted you, And gain you! You will come and see the girl, In whose most prodigal eyes, the lineal pearl And pride of all your lofty race of Leighs Is destined to solution. Authorised By sight and knowledge, then, youll speak your mind, And prove to Romney, in your brilliant way, Hell wrong the people and posterity Say such a thing is bad for you and me, And you fail utterly, by concluding thus An execrable marriage. Break it up, Disroot it—peradventure, presently, Well plant a better fortune in its place. Be good to me, Aurora, scorn me less For saying the thing I should not. Well I know I should not. I have kept, as others have, The iron rule of womanly reserve In lip and life, till now: I wept a week Before I came here.—Ending, she was pale; The last words, haughtily said, were tremulous. This palfrey pranced in harness, arched her neck, And, only by the foam upon the bit, You saw she champed against it. Then I rose. I love love! truths no cleaner thing than love. I comprehend a love so fiery hot It burns its natural veil of august shame, And stands sublimely in the nude, as chaste As Medicean Venus. But I know, A love that burns through veils, will burn through masks, And shrivel up treachery. What, love and lie! Nay—go to the opera! your loves curable. I love and lie? she said—I lie, forsooth? And beat her taper foot upon the floor, And smiled against the shoe, Youre hard, Miss Leigh, Unversed in current phrases.—Bowling-greens Of poets are fresher than the worlds highways; Forgive me that I rashly blew the dust Which dims our hedges even, in your eyes, And vexed you so much. You find, probably, No evil in this marriage, rather good Of innocence, to pastoralise in song: Youll give the bond your signature, perhaps, Beneath the ladys mark, indifferent That Romney chose a wife, could write her name, In witnessing he loved her. Loved! I cried; Who tells you that he wants a wife to love? He gets a horse to use, not love, I think: Theres work for wives as well, and after, straw, When men are liberal. For myself, you err Supposing power in me to break this match. I could not do it, to save Romneys life; And would not, to save mine. You take it so, She said; farewell then. Write your books in peace, As far as may be for some secret stir Now obvious to me, for, most obviously, In coming hither I mistook the way. Whereat she touched my hand, and bent her head, And floated from me like a silent cloud That leaves the sense of thunder. I drew breath As hard as in a sick room. After all This woman breaks her social system up For love, so counted—the love possible To such, and lilies are still lilies, pulled By smutty hands, though spotted from their white; And thus she is better, haply, of her kind, Than Romney Leigh, who lives by diagrams, And crosses out the spontaneities Of all his individual, personal life, With formal universals. As if man Were set upon a high stool at a desk, To keep Gods books for Him, in red and black, And feel by millions! What, if even God Were chiefly God by living out Himself To an individualism of the Infinite, Eterne, intense, profuse, still throwing up The golden spray of multitudinous worlds In measure to the proclive weight and rush Of His inner nature, the spontaneous love Still proof and outflow of spontaneous life? Then live, Aurora! Two hours afterward, Within St. Margarets Court I stood alone, Close-veiled. A sick child, from an ague-fit, Whose wasted right hand gambled gainst his left With an old brass button, in a blot of sun, Jeered weakly at me as I passed across The uneven pavement; while a woman, rouged Upon the angular cheek-bones, kerchief torn, Thin dangling locks, and flat lascivious mouth, Cursed at a window, both ways, in and out, By turns some bed-rid creature and myself, Lie still there, mother! liker the dead dog Youll be to-morrow. What, we pick our way, Fine madam, with those damnable small feet! We cover up our face from doing good, As if it were our purse! What brings you here, My lady? ist to find my gentleman Who visits his tame pigeon in the eaves? Our cholera catch you with its cramps and spasms, And tumble up your good clothes, veil and all, And turn your whiteness dead-blue. I looked up; I think I could have walked through hell that day, And never flinched. The dear Christ comfort you, I said, you must have been most miserable To be so cruel, and I emptied out My purse upon the stones: when, as I had cast The last charm in the cauldron, the whole court Went boiling, bubbling up, from all its doors And windows, with a hideous wail of laughs And roar of oaths, and blows perhaps,I passed Too quickly for distinguishing,and pushed A little side-door hanging on a hinge, And plunged into the dark, and groped and climbed The long, steep, narrow stair twixt broken rail And mildewed wall that let the plaster drop To startle me in the blackness. Still, up, up! So high lived Romneys bride. I paused at last Before a low door in the roof, and knocked; There came an answer like a hurried dove— So soon? can that be Mister Leigh? so soon? And as I entered, an ineffable face Met mine upon the threshold. Oh, not you, Not you!,the dropping of the voice implied, Then, if not you, for me not any one. I looked her in the eyes, and held her hands, And said, I am his cousin, Romney Leighs; And here I'm come to see my cousin too. She touched me with her face and with her voice, This daughter of the people. Such soft flowers, From such rough roots? the people, under there, Can sin so, curse so, look so, smell so,faugh! Yet have such daughters? No wise beautiful Was Marian Erle. She was not white nor brown, But could look either, like a mist that changed According to being shone on more or less. The hair, too, ran its opulence of curls In doubt twixt dark and bright, nor left you clear To name the colour. Too much hair perhaps Ill name a fault here for so small a head, Which seemed to droop on that side and on this, As a full-blown rose uneasy with its weight, Though not a breath should trouble it. Again, The dimple in the cheek had better gone With redder, fuller rounds: and somewhat large The mouth was, though the milky little teeth Dissolved it to so infantine a smile! For soon it smiled at me; the eyes smiled too, But twas as if remembering they had wept, And knowing they should, some day, weep again. We talked. She told me all her story out, Which Ill re-tell with fuller utterance, As coloured and confirmed in aftertimes By others, and herself too. Marian Erle Was born upon the ledge of Malvern Hill To eastward, in a hut, built up at night To evade the landlords eye, of mud and turf, Still liable, if once he looked that way, To being straight levelled, scattered by his foot, Like any other anthill. Born, I say; God sent her to his world, commissioned right, Her human testimonials fully signed, Not scant in soul—complete in lineaments; But others had to swindle her a place To wail in when she had come. No place for her, By mans law! born an outlaw, was this babe. Her first cry in our strange and strangling air, When cast in spasms out by the shuddering womb, Was wrong against the social code, forced wrong. What business had the baby to cry there? I tell her story and grow passionate. She, Marian, did not tell it so, but used Meek words that made no wonder of herself For being so sad a creature. Mister Leigh Considered truly that such things should change. They will, in heaven—but meantime, on the earth, Theres none can like a nettle as a pink, Except himself. Were nettles, some of us, And give offence by the act of springing up; And, if we leave the damp side of the wall, The hoes, of course, are on us. So she said. Her father earned his life by random jobs Despised by steadier workmen—keeping swine On commons, picking hops, or hurrying on The harvest at wet seasons, or, at need, Assisting the Welsh drovers, when a drove Of startled horses plunged into the mist Below the mountain-road, and sowed the wind With wandering neighings. In between the gaps Of such irregular work, he drank and slept, And cursed his wife because, the pence being out, She could not buy more drink. At which she turned, The worm and beat her baby in revenge For her own broken heart. Theres not a crime But takes its proper change out still in crime, If once rung on the counter of this world; Let sinners look to it. Yet the outcast child, For whom the very mothers face forewent The mothers special patience, lived and grew; Learnt early to cry low, and walk alone, With that pathetic vacillating roll Of the infant body on the uncertain feet, The earth being felt unstable ground so soon At which most womens arms unclose at once With irrepressive instinct. Thus, at three, This poor weaned kid would run off from the fold, This babe would steal off from the mothers chair, And, creeping through the golden walls of gorse, Would find some keyhole toward the secresy Of Heavens high blue, and, nestling down, peer out— Oh, not to catch the angels at their games, She had never heard of angels, but to gaze She knew not why, to see she knew not what, A-hungering outward from the barren earth For something like a joy. She liked, she said, To dazzle black her sight against the sky, For then, it seemed, some grand blind Love came down, And groped her out, and clasped her with a kiss; She learnt God that way, and was beat for it Whenever she went home, yet came again, As surely as the trapped hare, getting free, Returns to his form. This grand blind Love, she said, This skyey father and mother both in one, Instructed her and civilised her more Than even the Sunday-school did afterward, To which a lady sent her to learn books And sit upon a long bench in a row With other children. Well, she laughed sometimes To see them laugh and laugh, and moil their texts; But ofter she was sorrowful with noise, And wondered if their mothers beat them hard, That ever they should laugh so. There was one She loved indeed, Rose Bell, a seven years child, So pretty and clever, who read syllables When Marian was at letters; she would laugh At nothing—hold your finger up, she laughed, Then shook her curls down on her eyes and mouth To hide her make-mirth from the schoolmaster. And Roses pelting glee, as frank as rain On cherry-blossoms, brightened Marian too, To see another merry whom she loved. She whispered once the children side by side, With mutual arms entwined about their necks Your mother lets you laugh so? Ay, said Rose, She lets me. She was dug into the ground Six years since, I being but a yearling wean. Such mothers let us play and lose our time, And never scold nor beat us! dont you wish You had one like that? There, Marian breaking off Looked suddenly in my face. Poor Rose, said she, I heard her laugh last night in Oxford Street. Id pour out half my blood to stop that laugh, Poor Rose, poor Rose! said Marian. She resumed. It tried her, when she had learnt at Sunday-school What God was, what he wanted from us all, And how, in choosing sin, we vexed the Christ, To go straight home and hear her father pull The Name down on us from the thunder-shelf, Then drink away his soul into the dark From seeing judgment. Father, mother, home, Were God and heaven reversed to her: the more She knew of Right, the more she guessed their wrong; Her price paid down for knowledge, was to know The vileness of her kindred: through her heart, Her filial and tormented heart, henceforth, They struck their blows at virtue. Oh, tis hard To learn you have a father up in heaven By a gathering certain sense of being, on earth, Still worse than orphaned: tis too heavy a grief, The having to thank God for such a joy! And so passed Marians life from year to year. Her parents took her with them when they tramped, Dodged lanes and heaths, frequented towns and fairs, And once went farther and saw Manchester, And once the sea, that blue end of the world, That fair scroll-finis of a wicked book, And twice a prison, back at intervals, Returning to the hills. Hills draw like heaven, And stronger sometimes, holding out their hands To pull you from the vile flats up to them; And though, perhaps, these strollers still strolled back, As sheep do, simply that they knew the way, They certainly felt bettered unawares Emerging from the social smut of towns To wipe their feet clean on the mountain-turf. In which long wanderings, Marian lived and learned, Endured and learned. The people on the roads Would stop and ask her how her eyes outgrew Her cheeks, and if she meant to lodge the birds In all that hair; and then they lifted her, The miller in his cart, a mile or twain, The butchers boy on horseback. Often, too, The pedlar stopped, and tapped her on the head With absolute forefinger, brown and ringed, And asked if peradventure she could read; And when she answered ay, would toss her down Some stray odd volume from his heavy pack, A Thomsons Seasons, mulcted of the Spring, Or half a play of Shakspeares, torn across: She had to guess the bottom of a page By just the top sometimes, as difficult, As, sitting on the moon, to guess the earth! Or else a sheaf of leaves for that small Ruths Small gleanings torn out from the heart of books, From Churchyard Elegies and Edens Lost, From Burns, and Bunyan, Selkirk, and Tom Jones. Twas somewhat hard to keep the things distinct, And oft the jangling influence jarred the child Like looking at a sunset full of grace Through a pothouse window while the drunken oaths Went on behind her; but she weeded out Her book-leaves, threw away the leaves that hurt, First tore them small, that none should find a word And made a nosegay of the sweet and good To fold within her breast, and pore upon At broken moments of the noontide glare, When leave was given her to untie her cloak And rest upon the dusty roadside bank From the highways dust. Or oft, the journey done, Some city friend would lead her by the hand To hear a lecture at an institute: And thus she had grown, this Marian Erle of ours, To no book-learning, she was ignorant Of authors, not in earshot of the things Out-spoken oer the heads of common men, By men who are uncommon, but within The cadenced hum of such, and capable Of catching from the fringes of the wind Some fragmentary phrases, here and there, Of that fine music, which, being carried in To her soul, had reproduced itself afresh In finer motions of the lips and lids. She said, in speaking of it, If a flower Were thrown you out of heaven at intervals, Youd soon attain to a trick of looking up, And so with her. She counted me her years, Till I felt old; and then she counted me Her sorrowful pleasures, till I felt ashamed. She told me she was almost glad and calm On such and such a season; sate and sewed, With no one to break up her crystal thoughts; While rhymes from lovely poems span around Their ringing circles of ecstatic tune, Beneath the moistened finger of the Hour. Her parents called her a strange, sickly child, Not good for much, and given to sulk and stare, And smile into the hedges and the clouds, And tremble if one shook her from her fit By any blow, or word even. Out-door jobs Went ill with her; and household quiet work, She was not born to. Had they kept the north, They might have had their pennyworth out of her, Like other parents, in the factories; Your children work for you, not you for them, Or else they better had been choked with air The first breath drawn; but, in this tramping life, Was nothing to be done with such a child, But tramp and tramp. And yet she knitted hose Not ill, and was not dull at needlework; And all the country people gave her pence For darning stockings past their natural age, And patching petticoats from old to new, And other light work done for thrifty wives. One day, said Marian, the sun shone that day— Her mother had been badly beat, and felt The bruises sore about her wretched soul, That must have been: she came in suddenly, And snatching, in a sort of breathless rage, Her daughters headgear comb, let down the hair Upon her, like a sudden waterfall, And drew her drenched and passive, by the arm, Outside the hut they lived in. When the child Could clear her blinded face from all that stream Of tresses,there, a man stood, with beasts eyes, That seemed as they would swallow her alive, Complete in body and spirit, hair and all, With burning stertorous breath that hurt her cheek, He breathed so near. The mother held her tight, Saying hard between her teeth—Why wench, why wench, The squire speaks to you now—the squires too good; He means to set you up, and comfort us. Be mannerly at least. The child turned round, And looked up piteous in the mothers face, Be sure that mothers death-bed will not want Another devil to damn, than such a look,Oh, mother! then, with desperate glance to heaven, God, free me from my mother, she shrieked out, These mothers are too dreadful. And, with force As passionate as fear, she tore her hands Like lilies from the rocks, from hers and his, And sprang down, bounded headlong down the steep, Away from both—away, if possible, As far as God, away! They yelled at her, As famished hounds at a hare. She heard them yell, She felt her name hiss after her from the hills, Like shot from guns. On, on. And now she had cast The voices off with the uplands. On. Mad fear Was running in her feet and killing the ground; The white roads curled as if she burnt them up, The green fields melted, wayside trees fell back To make room for her. Then, her head grew vexed, Trees, fields, turned on her, and ran after her; She heard the quick pants of the hills behind, Their keen air pricked her neck. She had lost her feet, Could run no more, yet, somehow, went as fast, The horizon, red twixt steeples in the east, So sucked her forward, forward, while her heart Kept swelling, swelling, till it swelled so big It seemed to fill her body; then it burst, And overflowed the world and swamped the light, And now I am dead and safe, thought Marian Erle— She had dropped, she had fainted. When the sense returned, The night had passed—not lifes night. She was ware Of heavy tumbling motions, creaking wheels, The driver shouting to the lazy team That swung their rankling bells against her brain; While, through the waggons coverture and chinks, The cruel yellow morning pecked at her Alive or dead, upon the straw inside, At which her soul ached back into the dark And prayed, no more of that. A waggoner Had found her in a ditch beneath the moon, As white as moonshine, save for the oozing blood. At first he thought her dead; but when he had wiped The mouth and heard it sigh, he raised her up, And laid her in his waggon in the straw, And so conveyed her to the distant town To which his business called himself, and left That heap of misery at the hospital. She stirred;—the place seemed new and strange as death. The white strait bed, with others strait and white, Like graves dug side by side, at measured lengths, And quiet people walking in and out With wonderful low voices and soft steps, And apparitional equal care for each, Astonished her with order, silence, law: And when a gentle hand held out a cup, She took it, as you do at sacrament, Half awed, half melted, not being used, indeed, To so much love as makes the form of love And courtesy of manners. Delicate drinks And rare white bread, to which some dying eyes Were turned in observation. O my God, How sick we must be, ere we make men just! I think it frets the saints in heaven to see How many desolate creatures on the earth Have learnt the simple dues of fellowship And social comfort, in a hospital, As Marian did. She lay there, stunned, half tranced, And wished, at intervals of growing sense, She might be sicker yet, if sickness made The world so marvellous kind, the air so hushed, And all her wake-time quiet as a sleep; For now she understood, as such things were How sickness ended very oft in heaven, Among the unspoken raptures. Yet more sick, And surelier happy. Then she dropped her lids, And, folding up her hands as flowers at night, Would lose no moment of the blessed time. She lay and seethed in fever many weeks, But youth was strong and overcame the test; Revolted soul and flesh were reconciled And fetched back to the necessary day And daylight duties. She could creep about The long bare rooms, and stare out drearily From any narrow window on the street, Till some one, who had nursed her as a friend, Said coldly to her, as an enemy, She had leave to go next week, being well enough, While only her heart ached. Go next week, thought she, Next week! how would it be with her next week, Let out into that terrible street alone Among the pushing people,to go,where? One day, the last before the dreaded last, Among the convalescents, like herself Prepared to go next morning, she sate dumb, And heard half absently the women talk, How one was famished for her babys cheeks— The little wretch would know her! a year old, And lively, like his father! one was keen To get to work, and fill some clamorous mouths; And one was tender for her dear goodman Who had missed her sorely, and one, querulous,Would pay those scandalous neighbours who had dared To talk about her as already dead, And one was proud,and if her sweetheart Luke Had left her for a ruddier face than hers, The gossip would be seen through at a glance Sweet riddance of such sweethearts—let him hang! Twere good to have been as sick for such an end. And while they talked, and Marian felt the worse For having missed the worst of all their wrongs, A visitor was ushered through the wards And paused among the talkers. When he looked, It was as if he spoke, and when he spoke He sang perhaps, said Marian; could she tell? She only knew so much she had chronicled, As seraphs might, the making of the sun That he who came and spake, was Romney Leigh, And then, and there, she saw and heard him first. And when it was her turn to have the face Upon her, all those buzzing pallid lips Being satisfied with comfort—when he changed To Marian, saying And you? youre going, where?— She, moveless as a worm beneath a stone Which some ones stumbling foot has spurned aside, Writhed suddenly, astonished with the light, And breaking into sobs cried, Where I go? None asked me till this moment. Can I say Where I go? when it has not seemed worth while To God himself, who thinks of every one, To think of me, and fix where I shall go? So young, he gently asked her, you have lost Your father and your mother? Both, she said, Both lost! my father was burnt up with gin Or ever I sucked milk, and so is lost. My mother sold me to a man last month, And so my mothers lost, tis manifest. And I, who fled from her for miles and miles, As if I had caught sight of the fires of hell Through some wild gap, she was my mother, sir It seems I shall be lost too, presently, And so we end, all three of us. Poor child! He said, with such a pity in his voice, It soothed her more than her own tears, poor child! Tis simple that betrayal by mothers love Should bring despair of Gods too. Yet be taught; Hes better to us than many mothers are, And children cannot wander beyond reach Of the sweep of his white raiment. Touch and hold! And if you weep still, weep where John was laid While Jesus loved him. She could say the words, She told me, exactly as he uttered them A year back,since, in any doubt or dark, They came out like the stars, and shone on her With just their comfort. Common words, perhaps; The ministers in church might say the same; But he, he made the church with what he spoke, The difference was the miracle, said she. Then catching up her smile to ravishment, She added quickly, I repeat his words, But not his tones: can any one repeat The music of an organ, out of church? And when he said poor child, I shut my eyes To feel how tenderly his voice broke through, As the ointment-box broke on the Holy feet To let out the rich medicative nard. She told me how he had raised and rescued her With reverent pity, as, in touching grief, He touched the wounds of Christ, and made her feel More self-respecting. Hope, he called, belief In God, work, worship,therefore let us pray! And thus, to snatch her soul from atheism, And keep it stainless from her mothers face, He sent her to a famous sempstress-house Far off in London, there to work and hope. With that, they parted. She kept sight of Heaven, But not of Romney. He had good to do To others: through the days and through the nights, She sewed and sewed and sewed. She drooped sometimes, And wondered, while, along the tawny light, She struck the new thread into her needles eye, How people, without mothers on the hills, Could choose the town to live in!—then she drew The stitch, and mused how Romneys face would look, And if twere likely hed remember hers, When they two had their meeting after death. FOURTH BOOK. They met still sooner. Twas a year from thence When Lucy Gresham, the sick sempstress girl, Who sewed by Marians chair so still and quick, And leant her head upon the back to cough More freely when, the mistress turning round, The others took occasion to laugh out, Gave up at last. Among the workers, spoke A bold girl with black eyebrows and red lips, You know the news? Whos dying, do you think? Our Lucy Gresham. I expected it As little as Nell Harts wedding. Blush not, Nell, Thy curls be red enough without thy cheeks; And, some day, therell be found a man to dote On red curls.—Lucy Gresham swooned last night, Dropped sudden in the street while going home; And now the baker says, who took her up And laid her by her grandmother in bed, Hell give her a week to die in. Pass the silk. Lets hope he gave her a loaf too, within reach, For otherwise theyll starve before they die, That funny pair of bedfellows! Miss Bell, Ill thank you for the scissors. The old crone Is paralytic—thats the reason why Our Lucys thread went faster than her breath, Which went too quick, we all know. Marian Erle! Why, Marian Erle, youre not the fool to cry? Your tears spoil Lady Waldemars new dress, You piece of pity! Marian rose up straight, And, breaking through the talk and through the work, Went outward, in the face of their surprise, To Lucys home, to nurse her back to life Or down to death. She knew, by such an act, All place and grace were forfeit in the house, Whose mistress would supply the missing hand With necessary, not inhuman haste, And take no blame. But pity, too, had dues: She could not leave a solitary soul To founder in the dark, while she sate still And lavished stitches on a ladys hem As if no other work were paramount. Why, God, thought Marian, has a missing hand This moment; Lucy wants a drink, perhaps. Let others miss me! never miss me, God! So Marian sate by Lucys bed, content With duty, and was strong, for recompense, To hold the lamp of human love arm-high To catch the death-strained eyes and comfort them, Until the angels, on the luminous side Of death, had got theirs ready. And she said, When Lucy thanked her sometimes, called her kind, It touched her strangely. Marian Erle, called kind! What, Marian, beaten and sold, who could not die! Tis verily good fortune to be kind. Ah, you, she said, who are born to such a grace, Be sorry for the unlicensed class, the poor, Reduced to think the best good fortune means That others, simply, should be kind to them. From sleep to sleep while Lucy slid away So gently, like the light upon a hill, Of which none names the moment that it goes, Though all see when tis gone, a man came in And stood beside the bed. The old idiot wretch Screamed feebly, like a baby overlain, Sir, sir, you wont mistake me for the corpse? Dont look at me, sir! never bury me! Although I lie here, I'm alive as you, Except my legs and arms, I eat and drink, And understand, that youre the gentleman Who fits the funerals up, Heaven speed you, sir, And certainly I should be livelier still If Lucy here,sir, Lucy is the corpse,Had worked more properly to buy me wine: But Lucy, sir, was always slow at work, I shant lose much by Lucy. Marian Erle, Speak up and show the gentleman the corpse. And then a voice said, Marian Erle. She rose; It was the hour for angels—there, stood hers! She scarcely marvelled to see Romney Leigh. As light November snows to empty nests, As grass to graves, as moss to mildewed stones, As July suns to ruins, through the rents, As ministering spirits to mourners, through a loss, As Heaven itself to men, through pangs of death, He came uncalled wherever grief had come. And so, said Marian Erle, we met anew, And added softly, so, we shall not part. He was not angry that she had left the house Wherein he placed her. Well—she had feared it might Have vexed him. Also, when he found her set On keeping, though the dead was out of sight, That half-dead, half-live body left behind With cankerous heart and flesh, which took your best And cursed you for the little good it did, Could any leave the bedrid wretch alone, So joyless, she was thankless even to God, Much less to you? he did not say twas well, Yet Marian thought he did not take it ill, Since day by day he came, and, every day, She felt within his utterance and his eyes A closer, tenderer presence of the soul, Until at last he said, We shall not part. On that same day, was Marians work complete: She had smoothed the empty bed, and swept the floor Of coffin sawdust, set the chairs anew The dead had ended gossip in, and stood In that poor room so cold and orderly, The door-key in her hand, prepared to go As they had, howbeit not their way. He spoke. Dear Marian, of one clay God made us all, And though men push and poke and paddle int As children play at fashioning dirt-pies And call their fancies by the name of facts, Assuming difference, lordship, privilege, When alls plain dirt, they come back to it at last; The first grave-digger proves it with a spade, And pats all even. Need we wait for this, You, Marian, and I, Romney? She, at that, Looked blindly in his face, as when one looks Through driving autumn-rains to find the sky. He went on speaking. Marian, I being born What men call noble, and you, issued from The noble people, though the tyrannous sword Which pierced Christs heart, has cleft the world in twain Twixt class and class, opposing rich to poor, Shall we keep parted? Not so. Let us lean And strain together rather, each to each, Compress the red lips of this gaping wound, As far as two souls can, ay, lean and league, I, from my superabundance, from your want, You, joining in a protest gainst the wrong On both sides!— All the rest, he held her hand In speaking, which confused the sense of much; Her heart, against his words, beat out so thick, They might as well be written on the dust Where some poor bird, escaping from hawks beak, Has dropped, and beats its shuddering wings, the lines Are rubbed so, yet twas something like to this, —That they two, standing at the two extremes Of social classes, had received one seal, Been dedicate and drawn beyond themselves To mercy and ministration, he, indeed, Through what he knew, and she, through what she felt, He, by mans conscience, she, by womans heart, Relinquishing their several vantage posts Of wealthy ease and honourable toil, To work with God at love. And, since God willed That, putting out his hand to touch this ark, He found a womans hand there, hed accept The sign too, hold the tender fingers fast, And say, My fellow-worker, be my wife! She told the tale with simple, rustic turns, Strong leaps of meaning in her sudden eyes That took the gaps of any imperfect phrase Of the unschooled speaker: I have rather writ The thing I understood so, than the thing I heard so. And I cannot render right Her quick gesticulation, wild yet soft, Self-startled from the habitual mood she used, Half sad, half languid, like dumb creatures now A rustling bird, and now a wandering deer, Or squirrel against the oak-gloom flashing up His sidelong burnished head, in just her way Of savage spontaneity, that stir Abruptly the green silence of the woods, And make it stranger, holier, more profound; As Natures general heart confessed itself Of life, and then fell backward on repose. I kissed the lips that ended.—So indeed He loves you, Marian? Loves me! She looked up With a childs wonder when you ask him first Who made the sun—a puzzled blush, that grew, Then broke off in a rapid radiant smile Of sure solution. Loves me! he loves all, And me, of course. He had not asked me else To work with him for ever, and be his wife. Her words reproved me. This perhaps was love— To have its hands too full of gifts to give, For putting out a hand to take a gift; To love so much, the perfect round of love Includes, in strict conclusion, the being loved; As Eden-dew went up and fell again, Enough for watering Eden. Obviously She had not thought about his love at all: The cataracts of her soul had poured themselves, And risen self-crowned in rainbow: would she ask Who crowned her?—it sufficed that she was crowned. With women of my class, tis otherwise: We haggle for the small change of our gold, And so much love, accord, for so much love, Rialto-prices. Are we therefore wrong? If marriage be a contract, look to it then, Contracting parties should be equal, just; But if, a simple fealty on one side, A mere religion, right to give, is all, And certain brides of Europe duly ask To mount the pile, as Indian widows do, The spices of their tender youth heaped up, The jewels of their gracious virtues worn, More gems, more glory, to consume entire For a living husband! as the mans alive, Not dead, the womans duty, by so much, Advanced in England, beyond Hindostan. I sate there, musing, till she touched my hand With hers, as softly as a strange white bird She feared to startle in touching. You are kind. But are you, peradventure, vexed at heart Because your cousin takes me for a wife? I know I am not worthy—nay, in truth, I'm glad ont, since, for that, he chooses me. He likes the poor things of the world the best; I would not therefore, if I could, be rich. It pleasures him to stoop for buttercups; I would not be a rose upon the wall A queen might stop at, near the palace-door, To say to a courtier, Pluck that rose for me, Its prettier than the rest, O Romney Leigh! Id rather far be trodden by his foot, Than lie in a great queens bosom. Out of breath She paused. Sweet Marian, do you disavow The roses with that face? She dropt her head, As if the wind had caught that flower of her, And bent it in the garden, then looked up With grave assurance. Well, you think me bold! But so we all are, when were praying God. And if I'm bold—yet, lady, credit me, That, since I know myself for what I am, Much fitter for his handmaid than his wife, Ill prove the handmaid and the wife at once, Serve tenderly, and love obediently, And be a worthier mate, perhaps, than some Who are wooed in silk among their learned books; While I shall set myself to read his eyes, Till such grow plainer to me than the French To wisest ladies. Do you think Ill miss A letter, in the spelling of his mind? No more than they do, when they sit and write Their flying words with flickering wild-fowl tails, Nor ever pause to ask how many ts, Should that be y or i—they knowt so well: Ive seen them writing, when I brought a dress And waited, floating out their soft white hands On shining paper. But theyre hard sometimes, For all those hands!—weve used out many nights, And worn the yellow daylight into shreds Which flapped and shivered down our aching eyes Till night appeared more tolerable, just That pretty ladies might look beautiful, Who said at last,Youre lazy in that house! Youre slow in sending home the work, I count Ive waited near an hour fort. Pardon me, I do not blame them, madam, nor misprize; They are fair and gracious; ay, but not like you, Since none but you has Mister Leighs own blood Both noble and gentle, and, without it,well, They are fair, I said; so fair, it scarce seems strange That, flashing out in any looking-glass The wonder of their glorious brows and breasts, They are charmed so, they forget to look behind And mark how pale weve grown, we pitiful Remainders of the world. And so, perhaps, If Mister Leigh had chosen a wife from these, She might,although hes better than her best, And dearly she would know it,steal a thought Which should be all his, an eye-glance from his face, To plunge into the mirror opposite, In search of her own beautys pearl: while I  Ah, dearest lady, serge will outweigh silk For winter-wear, when bodies feel a-cold, And Ill be a true wife to your cousin Leigh. Before I answered, he was there himself. I think he had been standing in the room, And listened probably to half her talk, Arrested, turned to stone, as white as stone. Will tender sayings make men look so white? He loves her then profoundly. You are here, Aurora? Here I meet you!—We clasped hands. Even so, dear Romney. Lady Waldemar Has sent me in haste to find a cousin of mine Who shall be. Lady Waldemar is good. Heres one, at least, who is good, I sighed, and touched Poor Marians happy head, as, doglike, she Most passionately patient, waited on, A-tremble for her turn of greeting words; Ive sate a full hour with your Marian Erle, And learnt the thing by heart, and, from my heart, Am therefore competent to give you thanks For such a cousin. You accept at last A gift from me, Aurora, without scorn? At last I please you?—How his voice was changed! You cannot please a woman against her will, And once you vexed me. Shall we speak of that? Well say, then, you were noble in it all, And I not ignorant—let it pass. And now, You please me, Romney, when you please yourself; So, please you, be fanatical in love, And I'm well pleased. Ah, cousin! at the old hall, Among the gallery portraits of our Leighs, We shall not find a sweeter signory Than this pure foreheads. Not a word he said. How arrogant men are!—Even philanthropists, Who try to take a wife up in the way They put down a subscription-cheque, if once She turns and says, I will not tax you so, Most charitable sir, feel ill at ease, As though she had wronged them somehow. I suppose We women should remember what we are, And not throw back an obolus inscribed With Cæsars image, lightly. I resumed. It strikes me, some of those sublime Vandykes Were not too proud, to make good saints in heaven; And, if so, then theyre not too proud to-day To bow down now the ruffs are off their necks And own this good, true, noble Marian,yours, And mine, Ill say!—For poets bear the word Half-poets even, are still whole democrats, Oh, not that were disloyal to the high, But loyal to the low, and cognisant Of the less scrutable majesties. For me, I comprehend your choice—I justify Your right in choosing. No, no, no, he sighed, With a sort of melancholy impatient scorn, As some grown man, who never had a child, Puts by some child who plays at being a man; —You did not, do not, cannot comprehend My choice, my ends, my motives, nor myself: No matter now—well let it pass, you say. I thank you for your generous cousinship Which helps this present; I accept for her Your favourable thoughts. Were fallen on days, We two, who are not poets, when to wed Requires less mutual love than common love, For two together to bear out at once Upon the loveless many. Work in pairs, In galley-couplings or in marriage-rings, The difference lies in the honour, not the work, And such were bound to, I and she. But love, You poets are benighted in this age; The hours too late for catching even moths, Youve gnats instead, love!—loves fool-paradise Is out of date, like Adams. Set a swan To swim the Trenton, rather than true love To float its fabulous plumage safely down The cataracts of this loud transition-time, Whose roar, for ever, henceforth, in my ears, Must keep me deaf to music. There, I turned And kissed poor Marian, out of discontent. The man had baffled, chafed me, till I flung For refuge to the woman, as, sometimes, Impatient of some crowded rooms close smell, You throw a window open, and lean out To breathe a long breath in the dewy night, And cool your angry forehead. She, at least, Was not built up, as walls are, brick by brick; Each fancy squared, each feeling ranged by line, The very heat of burning youth applied To indurate forms and systems! excellent bricks, A well-built wall, which stops you on the road, And, into which, you cannot see an inch Although you beat your head against it—pshaw! Adieu, I said, for this time, cousins both; And, cousin Romney, pardon me the word, Be happy!—oh, in some esoteric sense Of course!—I mean no harm in wishing well. Adieu, my Marian:—may she come to me, Dear Romney, and be married from my house? It is not part of your philosophy To keep your bird upon the blackthorn? Ay, He answered, but it is:—I take my wife Directly from the people, and she comes, As Austrias daughter to imperial France, Betwixt her eagles, blinking not her race, From Margarets Court at garret-height, to meet And wed me at St. Jamess, nor put off Her gown of serge for that. The things we do, We do: well wear no mask, as if we blushed. Dear Romney, youre the poet, I replied, But felt my smile too mournful for my word, And turned and went. Ay, masks, I thought, beware Of tragic masks, we tie before the glass, Uplifted on the cothurn half a yard Above the natural stature! we would play Heroic parts to ourselves, and end, perhaps, As impotently as Athenian wives Who shrieked in fits at the Eumenides. His foot pursued me down the stair. At least, Youll suffer me to walk with you beyond These hideous streets, these graves, where men alive, Packed close with earthworms, burr unconsciously About the plague that slew them; let me go. The very women pelt their souls in mud At any woman who walks here alone. How came you here alone?—you are ignorant. We had a strange and melancholy walk: The night came drizzling downward in dark rain; And, as we walked, the colour of the time, The act, the presence, my hand upon his arm, His voice in my ear, and mine to my own sense, Appeared unnatural. We talked modern books, And daily papers; Spanish marriage-schemes, And English climate—wast so cold last year? And will the wind change by to-morrow morn? Can Guizot stand? is London full? is trade Competitive? has Dickens turned his hinge A-pinch upon the fingers of the great? And are potatoes to grow mythical Like moly? will the apple die out too? Which way is the wind to-night? south-east? due east? We talked on fast, while every common word Seemed tangled with the thunder at one end, And ready to pull down upon our heads A terror out of sight. And yet to pause Were surelier mortal: we tore greedily up All silence, all the innocent breathing-points, As if, like pale conspirators in haste, We tore up papers where our signatures Imperilled us to an ugly shame or death. I cannot tell you why it was. Tis plain We had not loved nor hated: wherefore dread To spill gunpowder on ground safe from fire? Perhaps we had lived too closely, to diverge So absolutely: leave two clocks, they say, Wound up to different hours, upon one shelf, And slowly, through the interior wheels of each, The blind mechanic motion sets itself A-throb, to feel out for the mutual time. It was not so with us, indeed. While he Struck midnight, I kept striking six at dawn, While he marked judgment, I, redemption-day; And such exception to a general law, Imperious upon inert matter even, Might make us, each to either, insecure, A beckoning mystery, or a troubling fear. I mind me, when we parted at the door, How strange his good-night sounded, like good-night Beside a deathbed, where the morrows sun Is sure to come too late for more good-days:— And all that night I thought  Good-night, said he. And so, a month passed. Let me set it down At once, I have been wrong, I have been wrong. We are wrong always, when we think too much Of what we think or are; albeit our thoughts Be verily bitter as self-sacrifice, Were no less selfish. If we sleep on rocks Or roses, sleeping past the hour of noon Were lazy. This I write against myself. I had done a duty in the visit paid To Marian, and was ready otherwise To give the witness of my presence and name Whenever she should marry.—Which, I thought, Sufficed. I even had cast into the scale An overweight of justice toward the match; The Lady Waldemar had missed her tool, Had broken it in the lock as being too straight For a crooked purpose, while poor Marian Erle Missed nothing in my accents or my acts: I had not been ungenerous on the whole, Nor yet untender; so, enough. I felt Tired, overworked: this marriage somewhat jarred; Or, if it did not, all the bridal noise,The pricking of the map of life with pins, In schemes of,Here well go, and There well stay, And Everywhere well prosper in our love, Was scarce my business. Let them order it; Who else should care? I threw myself aside, As one who had done her work and shuts her eyes To rest the better. I, who should have known, Forereckoned mischief! Where we disavow Being keeper to our brother, were his Cain. I might have held that poor child to my heart A little longer! twould have hurt me much To have hastened by its beats the marriage-day, And kept her safe meantime from tampering hands, Or, peradventure, traps? What drew me back From telling Romney plainly, the designs Of Lady Waldemar, as spoken out To me,me? had I any right, ay, right, With womanly compassion and reserve To break the fall of womans impudence?— To stand by calmly, knowing what I knew, And hear him call her good? Distrust that word. There is none good save God, said Jesus Christ. If He once, in the first creation-week, Called creatures good, for ever, afterward, The Devil only has done it, and his heirs, The knaves who win so, and the fools who lose; The words grown dangerous. In the middle age, I think they called malignant fays and imps Good people. A good neighbour, even in this, Is fatal sometimes, cuts your morning up To mince-meat of the very smallest talk, Then helps to sugar her bohea at night With your reputation. I have known good wives, As chaste, or nearly so, as Potiphars; And good, good mothers, who would use a child To better an intrigue; good friends, beside, Very good who hung succinctly round your neck And sucked your breath, as cats are fabled to do By sleeping infants. And we all have known Good critics, who have stamped out poets hopes; Good statesmen, who pulled ruin on the state; Good patriots, who, for a theory, risked a cause; Good kings, who disembowelled for a tax; Good popes, who brought all good to jeopardy; Good Christians, who sate still in easy chairs, And damned the general world for standing up.— Now, may the good God pardon all good men! How bitterly I speak, how certainly The innocent white milk in us is turned, By much persistent shining of the sun!— Shake up the sweetest in us long enough With men, it drops to foolish curd, too sour To feed the most untender of Christs lambs. I should have thought,a woman of the world Like her I'm meaning, centre to herself, Who has wheeled on her own pivot half a life In isolated self-love and self-will, As a windmill seen at distance radiating Its delicate white vans against the sky, So soft and soundless, simply beautiful, Seen nearer,what a roar and tear it makes, How it grinds and bruises!. if she loves at last, Her loves a re-adjustment of self-love, No more; a need felt of anothers use To her one advantage, as the mill wants grain, The fire wants fuel, the very wolf wants prey; And none of these is more unscrupulous Than such a charming woman when she loves. Shell not be thwarted by an obstacle So trifling as,her soul is,much less yours!— Is God a consideration?—she loves you, Not God; she will not flinch for Him indeed: She did not for the Marchioness of Perth, When wanting tickets for the birthnight-ball. She loves you, sir, with passion, to lunacy; She loves you like her diamonds,almost. Well, A month passed so, and then the notice came; On such a day the marriage at the church. I was not backward. Half St. Giles in frieze Was bidden to meet St. James in cloth of gold, And, after contract at the altar, pass To eat a marriage-feast on Hampstead Heath. Of course the people came in uncompelled, Lame, blind, and worse—sick, sorrowful, and worse, The humours of the peccant social wound All pressed out, poured out upon Pimlico, Exasperating the unaccustomed air With hideous interfusion: youd suppose A finished generation, dead of plague, Swept outward from their graves into the sun, The moil of death upon them. What a sight! A holiday of miserable men Is sadder than a burial-day of kings. They clogged the streets, they oozed into the church In a dark slow stream, like blood. To see that sight, The noble ladies stood up in their pews, Some pale for fear, a few as red for hate, Some simply curious, some just insolent, And some in wondering scorn, What next? what next? These crushed their delicate rose-lips from the smile That misbecame them in a holy place, With broidered hems of perfumed handkerchiefs; Those passed the salts with confidence of eyes And simultaneous shiver of moiré silk; While all the aisles, alive and black with heads, Crawled slowly toward the altar from the street, As bruised snakes crawl and hiss out of a hole With shuddering involutions, swaying slow From right to left, and then from left to right, In pants and pauses. What an ugly crest Of faces, rose upon you everywhere, From that crammed mass! you did not usually See faces like them in the open day: They hide in cellars, not to make you mad As Romney Leigh is.—Faces!—O my God, We call those, faces? mens and womens,ay, And childrens;—babies, hanging like a rag Forgotten on their mothers neck, poor mouths, Wiped clean of mothers milk by mothers blow, Before they are taught her cursing. Faces!. phew, Well call them vices festering to despairs, Or sorrows petrifying to vices: not A finger-touch of God left whole on them; All ruined, lost—the countenance worn out As the garments, the will dissolute as the acts, The passions loose and draggling in the dirt To trip the foot up at the first free step!— Those, faces! twas as if you had stirred up hell To heave its lowest dreg-fiends uppermost In fiery swirls of slime, such strangled fronts, Such obdurate jaws were thrown up constantly, To twit you with your race, corrupt your blood, And grind to devilish colours all your dreams Henceforth,though, haply, you should drop asleep By clink of silver waters, in a muse On Raffaels mild Madonna of the Bird. Ive waked and slept through many nights and days Since then, but still that day will catch my breath Like a nightmare. There are fatal days, indeed, In which the fibrous years have taken root So deeply, that they quiver to their tops Wheneer you stir the dust of such a day. My cousin met me with his eyes and hand, And then, with just a word,that Marian Erle Was coming with her bridesmaids presently, Made haste to place me by the altar-stair, Where he and other noble gentlemen And high-born ladies, waited for the bride. We waited. It was early: there was time For greeting, and the mornings compliment; And gradually a ripple of womens talk Arose and fell, and tossed about a spray Of English ss, soft as a silent hush, And, notwithstanding, quite as audible As louder phrases thrown out by the men. —Yes, really, if weve need to wait in church, Weve need to talk there.—She? Tis Lady Ayr, In blue—not purple! thats the dowager. —She looks as young.—She flirts as young, you mean! Why if you had seen her upon Thursday night, Youd call Miss Norris modest.—You again! I waltzed with you three hours back. Up at six, Up still at ten: scarce time to change ones shoes. I feel as white and sulky as a ghost, So pray dont speak to me, Lord Belcher.—No, Ill look at you instead, and its enough While you have that face. In church, my lord! fie, fie! —Adair, you stayed for the Division?—Lost By one. The devil it is! I'm sorry fort. And if I had not promised Mistress Grove, You might have kept your word to Liverpool. Constituents must remember, after all, Were mortal.—We remind them of it.—Hark, The bride comes! Here she comes, in a stream of milk! —There? Dear, you are asleep still; dont you know The five Miss Granvilles? always dressed in white To show theyre ready to be married.—Lower! The aunt is at your elbow.—Lady Maud, Did Lady Waldemar tell you she had seen This girl of Leighs? No, wait! twas Mrs. Brookes, Who told me Lady Waldemar told her— No, twasnt Mrs. Brookes.—Shes pretty?—Who? Mrs. Brookes? Lady Waldemar?—How hot! Pray ist the law to-day were not to breathe? Youre treading on my shawl—I thank you, sir. —They say the brides a mere child, who cant read, But knows the things she shouldnt, with wide-awake Great eyes. Id go through fire to look at her. —You do, I think.—And Lady Waldemar You see her; sitting close to Romney Leigh; How beautiful she looks, a little flushed! Has taken up the girl, and organised Leighs folly. Should I have come here, you suppose, Except shed asked me?—Shed have served him more By marrying him herself. Ah—there she comes, The bride, at last! Indeed, no. Past eleven. She puts off her patched petticoat to-day And puts on May-fair manners, so begins By setting us to wait.—Yes, yes, this Leigh Was always odd; its in the blood, I think; His fathers uncles cousins second son Was, was,you understand me—and for him, Hes stark!—has turned quite lunatic upon This modern question of the poor—the poor: An excellent subject when youre moderate; Youve seen Prince Alberts model lodging-house? Does honour to his Royal Highness. Good! But would he stop his carriage in Cheapside To shake a common fellow by the fist Whose name was,Shakspeare? no. We draw a line, And if we stand not by our order, we In England, we fall headlong. Heres a sight, A hideous sight, a most indecent sight! My wife would come, sir, or I had kept her back. By heaven, sir, when poor Damiens trunk and limbs Were torn by horses, women of the court Stood by and stared, exactly as to-day On this dismembering of society, With pretty troubled faces. Now, at last. She comes now. Where? who sees? you push me, sir, Beyond the point of what is mannerly. Youre standing, madam, on my second flounce— I do beseech you. No—its not the bride. Half-past eleven. How late. The bridegroom, mark, Gets anxious and goes out. And as I said,These Leighs! our best blood running in the rut! Its something awful. We had pardoned him A simple misalliance, got up aside For a pair of sky-blue eyes; our House of Lords Has winked at such things, and weve all been young. But heres an inter-marriage reasoned out, A contract carried boldly to the light, To challenge observation, pioneer Good acts by a great example twixt the extremes Of martyrised society, on the left, The well-born, on the right, the merest mob, To treat as equals!—tis anarchical! It means more than it says—tis damnable! Why, sir, we cant have even our coffee good, Unless we strain it. Here, Miss Leigh! Lord Howe, Youre Romneys friend. Whats all this waiting for? I cannot tell. The bride has lost her head And way, perhaps! to prove her sympathy With the bridegroom. What, you also, disapprove! Oh, I approve of nothing in the world, He answered; not of you, still less of me, Nor even of Romney—though hes worth us both. Were all gone wrong. The tune in us is lost: And whistling in back alleys to the moon, Will never catch it. Let me draw Lord Howe; A born aristocrat, bred radical, And educated socialist, who still Goes floating, on traditions of his kind, Across the theoretic flood from France, Though, like a drenched Noah on a rotten deck, Scarce safer for his place there. He, at least, Will never land on Ararat, he knows, To recommence the world on the old plan: Indeed, he thinks, said world had better end; He sympathises rather with the fish Outside, than with the drowned paired beasts within Who cannot couple again or multiply: And thats the sort of Noah he is, Lord Howe. He never could be anything complete, Except a loyal, upright gentleman, A liberal landlord, graceful diner-out, And entertainer more than hospitable, Whom authors dine with and forget the port. Whatever he believes, and it is much, But no-wise certain,now here and now there,He still has sympathies beyond his creed, Diverting him from action. In the House, No party counts upon him, and all praise All like his books too, he has written books Which, good to lie beside a bishops chair, So oft outreach themselves with jets of fire At which the foremost of the progressists May warm audacious hands in passing by. —Of stature over-tall, lounging for ease; Light hair, that seems to carry a wind in it, And eyes that, when they look on you, will lean Their whole weight half in indolence, and half In wishing you unmitigated good, Until you know not if to flinch from him Or thank him.—Tis Lord Howe. Were all gone wrong, Said he, and Romney, that dear friend of ours, Is no-wise right. Theres one true thing on earth; Thats love! He takes it up, and dresses it, And acts a play with it, as Hamlet did, To show what cruel uncles we have been, And how we should be uneasy in our minds, While he, Prince Hamlet, weds a pretty maid Who keeps us too long waiting, well confess By symbol, to instruct us formally To fill the ditches up twixt class and class, And live together in phalansteries. What then?—hes mad, our Hamlet! clap his play, And bind him. Ah Lord Howe, this spectacle Pulls stronger at us than the Danes. See there! The crammed aisles heave and strain and steam with life— Dear Heaven, what life! Why, yes, a poet sees; Which makes him different from a common man. I, too, see somewhat, though I cannot sing; I should have been a poet, only that My mother took fright at the ugly world, And bore me tongue-tied. If youll grant me now That Romney gives us a fine actor-piece To make us merry on his marriage-morn, The fables worse than Hamlets, Ill concede. The terrible people, old and poor and blind, Their eyes eat out with plague and poverty From seeing beautiful and cheerful sights, Well liken to a brutalised King Lear, Led out, by no means to clear scores with wrongs— His wrongs are so far back,he has forgot; Alls past like youth; but just to witness here A simple contract, he, upon his side, And Regan with her sister Goneril And all the dappled courtiers and court-fools, On their side. Not that any of these would say Theyre sorry, neither. What is done, is done, And violence is now turned privilege, As cream turns cheese, if buried long enough. What could such lovely ladies have to do With the old man there, in those ill-odorous rags, Except to keep the wind-side of him? Lear Is flat and quiet, as a decent grave; He does not curse his daughters in the least. Be these his daughters? Lear is thinking of His porridge chiefly,is it getting cold At Hampstead? will the ale be served in pots? Poor Lear, poor daughters! Bravo, Romneys play! A murmur and a movement drew around; A naked whisper touched us. Something wrong! Whats wrong? The black crowd, as an overstrained Cord, quivered in vibrations, and I saw,Was that his face I saw? his,Romney Leighs,Which tossed a sudden horror like a sponge Into all eyes, while himself stood white upon The topmost altar-stair, and tried to speak, And failed, and lifted higher above his head A letter,as a man who drowns and gasps. My brothers, bear with me! I am very weak. I meant but only good. Perhaps I meant Too proudly, and God snatched the circumstance And changed it therefore. Theres no marriage—none. She leaves me, she departs, she disappears, I lose her. Yet I never forced her ay, To have her no so cast into my teeth, In manner of an accusation, thus. My friends, you are all dismissed. Go, eat and drink According to the programme, and farewell! He ended. There was silence in the church; We heard a baby sucking in its sleep At the farthest end of the aisle. Then spoke a man, Now, look to it, coves, that all the beef and drink Be not filched from us like the other fun; For beers spilt easier than a woman is! This gentry is not honest with the poor; They bring us up, to trick us.—Go it, Jim, A woman screamed back, I'm a tender soul; I never banged a child at two years old And drew blood from him, but I sobbed for it Next moment, and Ive had a plague of seven. I'm tender; Ive no stomach even for beef, Until I know about the girl thats lost, Thats killed, mayhap. I did misdoubt, at first, The fine lord meant no good by her, or us. He, maybe, got the upper hand of her By holding up a wedding-ring, and then,A choking finger on her throat, last night, And just a clever tale to keep us still, As she is, poor lost innocent. Disappear! Who ever disappears except a ghost? And who believes a story of a ghost? I ask you, would a girl go off, instead Of staying to be married? a fine tale! A wicked man, I say, a wicked man! For my part I would rather starve on gin Than make my dinner on his beef and beer.— At which a cry rose up—Well have our rights. Well have the girl, the girl! Your ladies there Are married safely and smoothly every day, And she shall not drop through into a trap Because shes poor and of the people: shame! Well have no tricks played off by gentlefolks; Well see her righted. Through the rage and roar I heard the broken words which Romney flung Among the turbulent masses, from the ground He held still, with his masterful pale face— As huntsmen throw the ration to the pack, Who, falling on it headlong, dog on dog In heaps of fury, rend it, swallow it up With yelling hound-jaws, his indignant words, His piteous words, his most pathetic words, Whereof I caught the meaning here and there By his gesture,torn in morsels, yelled across, And so devoured. From end to end, the church Rocked round us like the sea in storm, and then Broke up like the earth in earthquake. Men cried out Police—and women stood and shrieked for God, Or dropt and swooned; or, like a herd of deer, For whom the black woods suddenly grow alive, Unleashing their wild shadows down the wind To hunt the creatures into corners, back And forward madly fled, or blindly fell, Trod screeching underneath the feet of those Who fled and screeched. The last sight left to me Was Romneys terrible calm face above The tumult!—the last sound was Pull him down! Strike—kill him! Stretching my unreasoning arms, As men in dreams, who vainly interpose Twixt gods and their undoing, with a cry I struggled to precipitate myself Head-foremost to the rescue of my soul In that white face,till some one caught me back, And so the world went out, I felt no more. What followed, was told after by Lord Howe, Who bore me senseless from the strangling crowd In church and street, and then returned alone To see the tumult quelled. The men of law Had fallen as thunder on a roaring fire, And made all silent, while the peoples smoke Passed eddying slowly from the emptied aisles. Heres Marians letter, which a ragged child Brought running, just as Romney at the porch Looked out expectant of the bride. He sent The letter to me by his friend Lord Howe Some two hours after, folded in a sheet On which his well-known hand had left a word. Heres Marians letter. Noble friend, dear saint, Be patient with me. Never think me vile, Who might to-morrow morning be your wife But that I loved you more than such a name. Farewell, my Romney. Let me write it once, My Romney. Tis so pretty a coupled word, I have no heart to pluck it with a blot. We say my God sometimes, upon our knees, Who is not therefore vexed: so bear with it,And me. I know I'm foolish, weak, and vain; Yet most of all I'm angry with myself For losing your last footstep on the stair, That last time of your coming, yesterday! The very first time I lost step of yours, Its sweetness comes the next to what you speak But yesterday sobs took me by the throat, And cut me off from music. Mister Leigh, Youll set me down as wrong in many things. Youve praised me, sir, for truth, and now youll learn I had not courage to be rightly true. I once began to tell you how she came, The woman,and you stared upon the floor In one of your fixed thoughts,which put me out For that day. After, some one spoke of me, So wisely, and of you, so tenderly, Persuading me to silence for your sake,Well, well! it seems this moment I was wrong In keeping back from telling you the truth: There might be truth betwixt us two, at least, If nothing else. And yet twas dangerous. Suppose a real angel came from heaven To live with men and women! hed go mad, If no considerate hand should tie a blind Across his piercing eyes. Tis thus with you: You see us too much in your heavenly light; I always thought so, angel, and indeed Theres danger that you beat yourself to death Against the edges of this alien world, In some divine and fluttering pity. Yes, It would be dreadful for a friend of yours, To see all England thrust you out of doors And mock you from the windows. You might say, Or think thats worse, Theres some one in the house I miss and love still. Dreadful! Very kind, I pray you mark, was Lady Waldemar. She came to see me nine times, rather ten— So beautiful, she hurts me like the day Let suddenly on sick eyes. Most kind of all, Your cousin!—ah, most like you! Ere you came She kissed me mouth to mouth: I felt her soul Dip through her serious lips in holy fire. God help me, but it made me arrogant; I almost told her that you would not lose By taking me to wife: though, ever since, Ive pondered much a certain thing she asked,He loves you, Marian?,in a sort of mild Derisive sadness,as a mother asks Her babe, Youll touch that star, you think? Farewell! I know I never touched it. This is worst: Babes grow, and lose the hope of things above; A silver threepence sets them leaping high— But no more stars! mark that. Ive writ all night, And told you nothing. God, if I could die, And let this letter break off innocent Just here! But no—for your sake,Heres the last: I never could be happy as your wife, I never could be harmless as your friend, I never will look more into your face, Till God says, Look! I charge you, seek me not, Nor vex yourself with lamentable thoughts That peradventure I have come to grief; Be sure I'm well, I'm merry, I'm at ease, But such a long way, long way, long way off, I think youll find me sooner in my grave, And thats my choice, observe. For what remains, An over-generous friend will care for me, And keep me happy,happier  Theres a blot! This ink runs thick,we light girls lightly weep,And keep me happier,was the thing to say,Than as your wife I could be!—O, my star, My saint, my soul! for surely youre my soul, Through whom God touched me! I am not so lost I cannot thank you for the good you did, The tears you stopped, which fell down bitterly, Like these—the times you made me weep for joy At hoping I should learn to write your notes And save the tiring of your eyes, at night; And most for that sweet thrice you kissed my lips And said Dear Marian. Twould be hard to read, This letter, for a reader half as learnd, But youll be sure to master it, in spite Of ups and downs. My hand shakes, I am blind, I'm poor at writing, at the best, and yet I tried to make my gs the way you showed. Farewell—Christ love you.—Say poor Marian now. Poor Marian!—wanton Marian!—was it so, Or so? For days, her touching, foolish lines We mused on with conjectural fantasy, As if some riddle of a summer-cloud On which one tries unlike similitudes Of now a spotted Hydra-skin cast off, And now a screen of carven ivory That shuts the heavens conventual secrets up From mortals over-bold. We sought the sense: She loved him so perhaps, such words mean love, That, worked on by some shrewd perfidious tongue, And then I thought of Lady Waldemar She left him, not to hurt him; or perhaps She loved one in her class, or did not love, But mused upon her wild bad tramping life, Until the free blood fluttered at her heart, And black bread eaten by the road-side hedge Seemed sweeter than being put to Romneys school Of philanthropical self-sacrifice, Irrevocably.—Girls are girls, beside, Thought I, and like a wedding by one rule. You seldom catch these birds, except with chaff: They feel it almost an immoral thing To go out and be married in broad day, Unless some winning special flattery should Excuse them to themselves fort,No one parts Her hair with such a silver line as you, One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown! Or else,You bite your lip in such a way, It spoils me for the smiling of the rest— And so on. Then a worthless gaud or two, To keep for love, a ribbon for the neck, Or some glass pin, they have their weight with girls. And Romney sought her many days and weeks: He sifted all the refuse of the town, Explored the trains, enquired among the ships, And felt the country through from end to end; No Marian!—Though I hinted what I knew, A friend of his had reasons of her own For throwing back the match—he would not hear: The lady had been ailing ever since, The shock had harmed her. Something in his tone Repressed me; something in me shamed my doubt To a sigh, repressed too. He went on to say That, putting questions where his Marian lodged, He found she had received for visitors, Besides himself and Lady Waldemar And, that once, me—a dubious woman dressed Beyond us both. The rings upon her hands Had dazed the children when she threw them pence; She wore her bonnet as the queen might hers, To show the crown, they said, a scarlet crown Of roses that had never been in bud. When Romney told me that, for now and then He came to tell me how the search advanced, His voice dropped: I bent forward for the rest: The woman had been with her, it appeared, At first from week to week, then day by day, And last, twas sure,I looked upon the ground To escape the anguish of his eyes, and asked As low as when you speak to mourners new Of those they cannot bear yet to call dead, If Marian had as much as named to him A certain Rose, an early friend of hers, A ruined creature. Never, Starting up He strode from side to side about the room, Most like some prisoned lion sprung awake, Who has felt the desert sting him through his dreams. What was I to her, that she should tell me aught? A friend! was I a friend? I see all clear. Such devils would pull angels out of heaven, Provided they could reach them; tis their pride; And thats the odds twixt soul and body-plague! The veriest slave who drops in Cairos street, Cries, Stand off from me, to the passengers; While these blotched souls are eager to infect, And blow their bad breath in a sisters face As if they got some ease by it. I broke through. Some natures catch no plagues. Ive read of babes Found whole and sleeping by the spotted breast Of one a full day dead. I hold it true, As I'm a woman and know womanhood, That Marian Erle, however lured from place, Deceived in way, keeps pure in aim and heart, As snow thats drifted from the garden-bank To the open road. Twas hard to hear him laugh. The figures happy. Well—a dozen carts And trampers will secure you presently A fine white snow-drift. Leave it there, your snow! Twill pass for soot ere sunset. Pure in aim? Shes pure in aim, I grant you, like myself, Who thought to take the world upon my back To carry it oer a chasm of social ill, And end by letting slip through impotence A single soul, a childs weight in a soul, Straight down the pit of hell! yes, I and she Have reason to be proud of our pure aims. Then softly, as the last repenting drops Of a thunder-shower, he added, The poor child; Poor Marian! twas a luckless day for her, When first she chanced on my philanthropy. He drew a chair beside me, and sate down; And I, instinctively, as women use Before a sweet friends grief, when, in his ear, They hum the tune of comfort, though themselves Most ignorant of the special words of such, And quiet so and fortify his brain And give it time and strength for feeling out To reach the availing sense beyond that sound, Went murmuring to him, what, if written here, Would seem not much, yet fetched him better help Than, peradventure, if it had been more. Ive known the pregnant thinkers of this time, And stood by breathless, hanging on their lips, When some chromatic sequence of fine thought In learned modulation phrased itself To an unconjectured harmony of truth. And yet Ive been more moved, more raised, I say, By a simple word,a broken easy thing, A three-years infant might say after you, A look, a sigh, a touch upon the palm, Which meant less than I love you,than by all The full-voiced rhetoric of those master-mouths. Ah dear Aurora, he began at last, His pale lips fumbling for a sort of smile, Your printers devils have not spoilt your heart: Thats well. And who knows but, long years ago, When you and I talked, you were somewhat right In being so peevish with me? You, at least, Have ruined no one through your dreams! Instead, Youve helped the facile youth to live youths day With innocent distraction, still perhaps Suggestive of things better than your rhymes. The little shepherd-maiden, eight years old, Ive seen upon the mountains of Vaucluse, Asleep i the sun, her head upon her knees, The flocks all scattered, is more laudable Than any sheep-dog trained imperfectly, Who bites the kids through too much zeal. I look As if I had slept, then? He was touched at once By something in my face. Indeed twas sure That he and I, despite a year or two Of younger life on my side, and on his, The heaping of the years work on the days, The three-hour speeches from the members seat, The hot committees, in and out the House, The pamphlets, Arguments, Collective Views, Tossed out as straw before sick houses, just To show ones sick and so be trod to dirt, And no more use, through this worlds underground The burrowing, groping effort, whence the arm And heart come bleeding, sure, that he and I Were, after all, unequally fatigued! That he, in his developed manhood, stood A little sunburnt by the glare of life; While I,it seemed no sun had shone on me, So many seasons I had forgot my Springs; My cheeks had pined and perished from their orbs, And all the youth-blood in them had grown white As dew on autumn cyclamens: alone My eyes and forehead answered for my face. He said,Aurora, you are changed—are ill! Not so, my cousin, only not asleep! I answered, smiling gently. Let it be. You scarcely found the poet of Vaucluse As drowsy as the shepherds. What is art, But life upon the larger scale, the higher, When, graduating up in a spiral line Of still expanding and ascending gyres, It pushes toward the intense significance Of all things, hungry for the Infinite? Arts life, and where we live, we suffer and toil. He seemed to sift me with his painful eyes. Alas! you take it gravely; you refuse Your dreamland, right of common, and green rest. You break the mythic turf where danced the nymphs, With crooked ploughs of actual life, let in The axes to the legendary woods, To pay the head-tax. You are fallen indeed On evil days, you poets, if yourselves Can praise that art of yours no otherwise; And, if you cannot,better take a trade And be of use! twere cheaper for your youth. Of use! I softly echoed, theres the point We sweep about for ever in argument; Like swallows, which the exasperate, dying year Sets spinning in black circles, round and round, Preparing for far flights oer unknown seas. And we,where tend we? Where? he said, and sighed. The whole creation, from the hour we are born, Perplexes us with questions. Not a stone But cries behind us, every weary step, Where, where? I leave stones to reply to stones. Enough for me and for my fleshly heart To harken the invocations of my kind, When men catch hold upon my shuddering nerves And shriek, What help? what hope? what bread i the house, What fire i the frost? There must be some response, Though mine fail utterly. This social Sphinx, Who sits between the sepulchres and stews, Makes mock and mow against the crystal heavens, And bullies God, exacts a word at least From each man standing on the side of God, However paying a sphinx-price for it. We pay it also if we hold our peace, In pangs and pity. Let me speak and die. Alas! youll say, I speak and kill, instead. I pressed in there; The best men, doing their best, Know peradventure least of what they do: Men usefullest i the world, are simply used; The nail that holds the wood, must pierce it first, And He alone who wields the hammer, sees The work advanced by the earliest blow. Take heart. Ah, if I could have taken yours! he said, But thats past now, Then rising,I will take At least your kindness and encouragement. I thank you. Dear, be happy. Sing your songs, If thats your way! but sometimes slumber too, Nor tire too much with following, out of breath, The rhymes upon your mountains of Delight. Reflect, if Art be, in truth, the higher life, You need the lower life to stand upon, In order to reach up unto that higher; And none can stand a-tiptoe in the place He cannot stand in with two stable feet. Remember then!—for Arts sake, hold your life. We parted so. I held him in respect. I comprehended what he was in heart And sacrificial greatness. Ay, but he Supposed me a thing too small to deign to know: He blew me, plainly, from the crucible, As some intruding, interrupting fly Not worth the pains of his analysis Absorbed on nobler subjects. Hurt a fly! He would not for the world: hes pitiful To flies even. Sing, says he, and teaze me still, If thats your way, poor insect. That's your way! FIFTH BOOK. Aurora Leigh, be humble. Shall I hope To speak my poems in mysterious tune With man and nature, with the lava-lymph That trickles from successive galaxies Still drop by drop adown the finger of God, In still new worlds?—with summer-days in this, That scarce dare breathe, they are so beautiful?— With springs delicious trouble in the ground Tormented by the quickened blood of roots, And softly pricked by golden crocus-sheaves In token of the harvest-time of flowers?— With winters and with autumns, and beyond, With the human hearts large seasons, when it hopes And fears, joys, grieves, and loves?—with all that strain Of sexual passion, which devours the flesh In a sacrament of souls? with mothers breasts, Which, round the new-made creatures hanging there, Throb luminous and harmonious like pure spheres?— With multitudinous life, and finally With the great out-goings of ecstatic souls, Who, in a rush of too long prisoned flame, Their radiant faces upward, burn away This dark of the body, issuing on a world Beyond our mortal?—can I speak my verse So plainly in tune to these things and the rest, That men shall feel it catch them on the quick, As having the same warrant over them To hold and move them, if they will or no, Alike imperious as the primal rhythm Of that theurgic nature? I must fail, Who fail at the beginning to hold and move One man, and he my cousin, and he my friend, And he born tender, made intelligent, Inclined to ponder the precipitous sides Of difficult questions; yet, obtuse to me, Of me, incurious! likes me very well, And wishes me a paradise of good, Good looks, good means, and good digestion!—ay, But otherwise evades me, puts me off With kindness, with a tolerant gentleness, Too light a book for a grave mans reading! Go, Aurora Leigh: be humble. There it is; We women are too apt to look to one, Which proves a certain impotence in art. We strain our natures at doing something great, Far less because its something great to do, Than, haply, that we, so, commend ourselves As being not small, and more appreciable To some one friend. We must have mediators Betwixt our highest conscience and the judge; Some sweet saints blood must quicken in our palms, Or all the life in heaven seems slow and cold: Good only, being perceived as the end of good, And God alone pleased, thats too poor, we think, And not enough for us, by any means. Ay—Romney, I remember, told me once We miss the abstract, when we comprehend! We miss it most when we aspire,and fail. Yet, so, I will not.—This vile womans way Of trailing garments, shall not trip me up. Ill have no traffic with the personal thought In arts pure temple. Must I work in vain, Without the approbation of a man? It cannot be; it shall not. Fame itself, That approbation of the general race, Presents a poor end, though the arrow speed, Shot straight with vigorous finger to the white, And the highest fame was never reached except By what was aimed above it. Art for art, And good for God Himself, the essential Good! Well keep our aims sublime, our eyes erect, Although our woman-hands should shake and fail; And if we fail  But must we?— Shall I fail? The Greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase, Let no one be called happy till his death. To which I add, Let no one till his death Be called unhappy. Measure not the work Until the days out and the labour done; Then bring your gauges. If the days works scant, Why, call it scant; affect no compromise; And, in that we have nobly striven at least, Deal with us nobly, women though we be, And honour us with truth, if not with praise. My ballads prospered; but the ballads race Is rapid for a poet who bears weights Of thought and golden image. He can stand Like Atlas, in the sonnet, and support His own heavens pregnant with dynastic stars; But then he must stand still, nor take a step. In that descriptive poem called The Hills, The prospects were too far and indistinct. Tis true my critics said, A fine view, that! The public scarcely cared to climb the book For even the finest; and the publics right, A trees mere firewood, unless humanised; Which well the Greeks knew, when they stirred the bark With close-pressed bosoms of subsiding nymphs, And made the forest-rivers garrulous With babble of gods. For us, we are called to mark A still more intimate humanity In this inferior nature, or, ourselves, Must fall like dead leaves trodden underfoot By veritabler artists. Earth, shut up By Adam, like a fakir in a box Left too long buried, remained stiff and dry, A mere dumb corpse, till Christ the Lord came down, Unlocked the doors, forced open the blank eyes, And used his kingly chrisms to straighten out The leathery tongue turned back into the throat: Since when, she lives, remembers, palpitates In every limb, aspires in every breath, Embraces infinite relations. Now, We want no half-gods, Panomphæan Joves, Fauns, Naiads, Tritons, Oreads and the rest, To take possession of a senseless world To unnatural vampire-uses. See the earth, The body of our body, the green earth, Indubitably human, like this flesh And these articulated veins through which Our heart drives blood! theres not a flower of spring, That dies ere June, but vaunts itself allied By issue and symbol, by significance And correspondence, to that spirit-world Outside the limits of our space and time, Whereto we are bound. Let poets give it voice With human meanings; else they miss the thought, And henceforth step down lower, stand confessed Instructed poorly for interpreters, Thrown out by an easy cowslip in the text. Even so my pastoral failed: it was a book Of surface-pictures—pretty, cold, and false With literal transcript, the worse done, I think, For being not ill-done. Let me set my mark Against such doings, and do otherwise. This strikes me.—If the public whom we know, Could catch me at such admissions, I should pass For being right modest. Yet how proud we are, In daring to look down upon ourselves! The critics say that epics have died out With Agamemnon and the goat-nursed gods— Ill not believe it. I could never dream As Payne Knight did, the mythic mountaineer Who travelled higher than he was born to live, And showed sometimes the goitre in his throat Discoursing of an image seen through fog, That Homers heroes measured twelve feet high. They were but men!—his Helens hair turned grey Like any plain Miss Smiths, who wears a front; And Hectors infant blubbered at a plume As yours last Friday at a turkey-cock. All men are possible heroes: every age, Heroic in proportions, double-faced, Looks backward and before, expects a morn And claims an epos. Ay, but every age Appears to souls who live in it, ask Carlyle Most unheroic. Ours, for instance, ours! The thinkers scout it, and the poets abound Who scorn to touch it with a finger-tip: A pewter age, mixed metal, silver-washed; An age of scum, spooned off the richer past; An age of patches for old gaberdines; An age of mere transition, meaning nought, Except that what succeeds must shame it quite, If God please. Thats wrong thinking, to my mind, And wrong thoughts make poor poems. Every age, Through being beheld too close, is ill-discerned By those who have not lived past it. Well suppose Mount Athos carved, as Persian Xerxes schemed, To some colossal statue of a man: The peasants, gathering brushwood in his ear, Had guessed as little of any human form Up there, as would a flock of browsing goats. Theyd have, in fact, to travel ten miles off Or ere the giant image broke on them, Full human profile, nose and chin distinct, Mouth, muttering rhythms of silence up the sky, And fed at evening with the blood of suns; Grand torso, hand, that flung perpetually The largesse of a silver river down To all the country pastures. Tis even thus With times we live in, evermore too great To be apprehended near. But poets should Exert a double vision; should have eyes To see near things as comprehensively As if afar they took their point of sight, And distant things, as intimately deep, As if they touched them. Let us strive for this. I do distrust the poet who discerns No character or glory in his times, And trundles back his soul five hundred years, Past moat and drawbridge, into a castle-court, Oh not to sing of lizards or of toads Alive i the ditch there!—twere excusable; But of some black chief, half knight, half sheep-lifter, Some beauteous dame, half chattel and half queen, As dead as must be, for the greater part, The poems made on their chivalric bones. And thats no wonder: death inherits death. Nay, if theres room for poets in the world A little overgrown, I think there is Their sole work is to represent the age, Their age, not Charlemagnes, this live, throbbing age, That brawls, cheats, maddens, calculates, aspires, And spends more passion, more heroic heat, Betwixt the mirrors of its drawing-rooms, Than Roland with his knights, at Roncesvalles. To flinch from modern varnish, coat or flounce, Cry out for togas and the picturesque, Is fatal, foolish too. King Arthurs self Was commonplace to Lady Guenever; And Camelot to minstrels seemed as flat, As Regent Street to poets. Never flinch, But still, unscrupulously epic, catch Upon the burning lava of a song, The full-veined, heaving, double-breasted Age: That, when the next shall come, the men of that May touch the impress with reverent hand, and say Behold, behold the paps we all have sucked! That bosom seems to beat still, or at least It sets ours beating. This is living art, Which thus presents, and thus records true life. What form is best for poems? Let me think Of forms less, and the external. Trust the spirit, As sovran nature does, to make the form; For otherwise we only imprison spirit, And not embody. Inward evermore To outward, so in life, and so in art, Which still is life. Five acts to make a play. And why not fifteen? why not ten? or seven? What matter for the number of the leaves, Supposing the tree lives and grows? exact The literal unities of time and place, When tis the essence of passion to ignore Both time and place? Absurd. Keep up the fire, And leave the generous flames to shape themselves. Tis true the stage requires obsequiousness To this or that convention; exit here And enter there; the points for clapping, fixed, Like Jacobs white-peeled rods before the rams; And all the close-curled imagery clipped In manner of their fleece at shearing-time. Forget to prick the galleries to the heart Precisely at the fourth act, culminate Our five pyramidal acts with one act more, Were lost so! Shakspeares ghost could scarcely plead Against our just damnation. Stand aside; Well muse for comfort that, last century, On this same tragic stage on which we have failed, A wigless Hamlet would have failed the same. And whosoever writes good poetry, Looks just to art. He does not write for you Or me, for London or for Edinburgh; He will not suffer the best critic known To step into his sunshine of free thought And self-absorbed conception, and exact An inch-long swerving of the holy lines. If virtue done for popularity Defiles like vice, can art for praise or hire Still keep its splendor, and remain pure art? Eschew such serfdom. What the poet writes, He writes: mankind accepts it, if it suits, And thats success: if not, the poems passed From hand to hand, and yet from hand to hand, Until the unborn snatch it, crying out In pity on their fathers being so dull, And thats success too. I will write no plays. Because the drama, less sublime in this, Makes lower appeals, defends more menially, Adopts the standard of the public taste To chalk its height on, wears a dog-chain round Its regal neck, and learns to carry and fetch The fashions of the day to please the day; Fawns close on pit and boxes, who clap hands, Commending chiefly its docility And humour in stage-tricks; or else indeed Gets hissed at, howled at, stamped at like a dog, Or worse, well say. For dogs, unjustly kicked, Yell, bite at need; but if your dramatist Being wronged by some five hundred nobodies Because their grosser brains most naturally Misjudge the fineness of his subtle wit Shows teeth an almonds breadth, protests the length Of a modest phrase, My gentle countrymen, Theres something in it, haply, of your fault, Why then, besides five hundred nobodies, Hell have five thousand, and five thousand more, Against him, the whole public, all the hoofs Of King Sauls fathers asses, in full drove, And obviously deserve it. He appealed To these, and why say more if they condemn, Than if they praised him?—Weep, my Æschylus, But low and far, upon Sicilian shores! For since twas Athens so I read the myth Who gave commission to that fatal weight, The tortoise, cold and hard, to drop on thee And crush thee, better cover thy bald head; Shell hear the softest hum of Hyblan bee Before thy loudst protesting.—For the rest, The risks still worse upon the modern stage: I could not, in so little, accept success, Nor would I risk so much, in ease and calm, For manifester gains; let those who prize, Pursue them: I stand off. And yet, forbid, That any irreverent fancy or conceit Should litter in the Dramas throne-room, where The rulers of our art, in whose full veins Dynastic glories mingle, sit in strength And do their kingly work, conceive, command, And, from the imaginations crucial heat, Catch up their men and women all a-flame For action, all alive, and forced to prove Their life by living out heart, brain, and nerve, Until mankind makes witness, These be men As we are, and vouchsafes the kiss thats due To Imogen and Juliet—sweetest kin On arts side. Tis that, honouring to its worth The drama, I would fear to keep it down To the level of the footlights. Dies no more The sacrificial goat, for Bacchus slain, His filmed eyes fluttered by the whirling white Of choral vestures, troubled in his blood, While tragic voices that clanged keen as swords, Leapt high together with the altar-flame, And made the blue air wink. The waxen mask, Which set the grand still front of Themis son Upon the puckered visage of a player;— The buskin, which he rose upon and moved, As some tall ship, first conscious of the wind, Sweeps slowly past the piers;—the mouthpiece, where The mere mans voice with all its breaths and breaks Went sheathed in brass, and clashed on even heights Its phrasèd thunders;—these things are no more, Which once were. And concluding, which is clear, The growing drama has outgrown such toys Of simulated stature, face, and speech, It also, peradventure, may outgrow The simulation of the painted scene, Boards, actors, prompters, gaslight, and costume; And take for a worthier stage the soul itself, Its shifting fancies and celestial lights, With all its grand orchestral silences To keep the pauses of the rhythmic sounds. Alas, I still see something to be done, And what I do falls short of what I see Though I waste myself on doing. Long green days, Worn bare of grass and sunshine, long calm nights, From which the silken sleeps were fretted out, Be witness for me, with no amateurs Irreverent haste and busy idleness Ive set myself to art! What then? whats done? Whats done, at last? Behold, at last, a book. If life-bloods necessary, which it is, By that blue vein athrob on Mahomets brow, Each prophet-poets book must show mans blood! If life-bloods fertilising, I wrung mine On every leaf of this, unless the drops Slid heavily on one side and left it dry. That chances often: many a fervid man Writes books as cold and flat as grave-yard stones From which the lichens scraped; and if St. Preux Had written his own letters, as he might, We had never wept to think of the little mole Neath Julies drooping eyelid. Passion is But something suffered, after all. While Art Sets action on the top of suffering: The artists part is both to be and do, Transfixing with a special, central power The flat experience of the common man, And turning outward, with a sudden wrench, Half agony, half ecstasy, the thing He feels the inmost: never felt the less Because he sings it. Does a torch less burn For burning next reflectors of blue steel, That he should be the colder for his place Twixt two incessant fires, his personal lifes, And that intense refraction which burns back Perpetually against him from the round Of crystal conscience he was born into If artist-born? O sorrowful great gift Conferred on poets, of a twofold life, When one life has been found enough for pain! We, staggering neath our burden as mere men, Being called to stand up straight as demi-gods, Support the intolerable strain and stress Of the universal, and send clearly up With voices broken by the human sob, Our poems to find rhymes among the stars! But soft!—a poet is a word soon said; A books a thing soon written. Nay, indeed, The more the poet shall be questionable, The more unquestionably comes his book! And this of mine—well, granting to myself Some passion in it, furrowing up the flats, Mere passion will not prove a volume worth Its gall and rags even. Bubbles round a keel Mean nought, excepting that the vessel moves. Theres more than passion goes to make a man, Or book, which is a man too. I am sad. I wonder if Pygmalion had these doubts, And, feeling the hard marble first relent, Grow supple to the straining of his arms, And tingle through its cold to his burning lip, Supposed his senses mocked, and that the toil Of stretching past the known and seen, to reach The archetypal Beauty out of sight, Had made his heart beat fast enough for two, And with his own life dazed and blinded him! Not so; Pygmalion loved, and whoso loves Believes the impossible. And I am sad: I cannot thoroughly love a work of mine, Since none seems worthy of my thought and hope More highly mated. He has shot them down, My Phœbus Apollo, soul within my soul, Who judges, by the attempted, whats attained, And with the silver arrow from his height, Has struck down all my works before my face, While I said nothing. Is there aught to say? I called the artist but a greatened man; He may be childless also, like a man. I laboured on alone. The wind and dust And sun of the world beat blistering in my face; And hope, now for me, now against me, dragged My spirits onward, as some fallen balloon, Which, whether caught by blossoming tree or bare, Is torn alike. I sometimes touched my aim, Or seemed, and generous souls cried out, Be strong, Take courage; now youre on our level, now! The next step saves you! I was flushed with praise, But, pausing just a moment to draw breath, I could not choose but murmur to myself Is this all? all thats done? and all thats gained? If this then be success, tis dismaller Than any failure. O my God, my God, O supreme Artist, who as sole return For all the cosmic wonder of Thy work, Demandest of us just a word,a name, My Father!—thou hast knowledge, only thou, How dreary tis for women to sit still On winter nights by solitary fires, And hear the nations praising them far off, Too far! ay, praising our quick sense of love, Our very heart of passionate womanhood, Which could not beat so in the verse without Being present also in the unkissed lips, And eyes undried because theres none to ask The reason they grew moist. To sit alone, And think, for comfort, how, that very night, Affianced lovers, leaning face to face With sweet half-listenings for each others breath, Are reading haply from some page of ours, To pause with a thrill, as if their cheeks had touched, When such a stanza, level to their mood, Seems floating their own thought out—So I feel For thee, And I, for thee: this poet knows What everlasting love is!—how, that night, A father, issuing from the misty roads Upon the luminous round of lamp and hearth And happy children, having caught up first The youngest there until it shrunk and shrieked To feel the cold chin prick its dimples through With winter from the hills, may throw i the lap Of the eldest, who has learnt to drop her lids To hide some sweetness newer than last years Our book and cry,Ah you, you care for rhymes; So here be rhymes to pore on under trees, When April comes to let you! Ive been told They are not idle as so many are, But set hearts beating pure as well as fast: Its yours, the book; Ill write your name in it, That so you may not lose, however lost In poets lore and charming reverie, The thought of how your father thought of you In riding from the town. To have our books Appraised by love, associated with love, While we sit loveless! is it hard, you think? At least tis mournful. Fame, indeed, twas said, Means simply love. It was a man said that. And then, theres love and love: the love of all To risk, in turn, a womans paradox, Is but a small thing to the love of one. You bid a hungry child be satisfied With a heritage of many corn-fields: nay, He says hes hungry, he would rather have That little barley-cake you keep from him While reckoning up his harvests. So with us; Here, Romney, too, we fail to generalise! Were hungry. Hungry! but its pitiful To wail like unweaned babes and suck our thumbs Because were hungry. Who, in all this world, Wherein we are haply set to pray and fast, And learn what good is by its opposite Has never hungered? Woe to him who has found The meal enough! if Ugolinos full, His teeth have crunched some foul unnatural thing: For here satiety proves penury More utterly irremediable. And since We needs must hunger, better, for mans love, Than Gods truth! better, for companions sweet, Than great convictions! let us bear our weights, Preferring dreary hearths to desert souls. Well, well! they say were envious, we who rhyme; But I, because I am a woman perhaps, And so rhyme ill, am ill at envying. I never envied Graham his breadth of style, Which gives you, with a random smutch or two, Near-sighted critics analyse to smutch Such delicate perspectives of full life; Nor Belmore, for the unity of aim To which he cuts his cedarn poems, fine As sketchers do their pencils; nor Mark Gage, For that caressing colour and trancing tone Whereby youre swept away and melted in The sensual element, which, with a back wave, Restores you to the level of pure souls And leaves you with Plotinus. None of these, For native gifts or popular applause, Ive envied; but for this, that when, by chance, Says some one, There goes Belmore, a great man! He leaves clean work behind him, and requires No sweeper up of the chips,a girl I know, Who answers nothing, save with her brown eyes, Smiles unaware, as if a guardian saint Smiled in her:—for this, too, that Gage comes home And lays his last books prodigal review Upon his mothers knees, where, years ago, He had laid his childish spelling-book and learned To chirp and peck the letters from her mouth, As young birds must. Well done, she murmured then, She will not say it now more wonderingly; And yet the last Well done will touch him more, As catching up to-day and yesterday In a perfect chord of love; and so, Mark Gage. I envy you your mother!—and you, Graham, Because you have a wife who loves you so, She half forgets, at moments, to be proud Of being Grahams wife, until a friend observes, The boy here, has his fathers massive brow, Done small in wax,if we push back the curls. Who loves me? Dearest father, mother sweet, I speak the names out sometimes by myself, And make the silence shiver: they sound strange, As Hindostanee to an Ind-born man Accustomed many years to English speech; Or lovely poet-words grown obsolete, Which will not leave off singing. Up in heaven I have my father, with my mothers face Beside him in a blotch of heavenly light; No more for earths familiar, household use, No more! The best verse written by this hand, Can never reach them where they sit, to seem Well-done to them. Death quite unfellows us, Sets dreadful odds betwixt the live and dead, And makes us part as those at Babel did, Through sudden ignorance of a common tongue. A living Cæsar would not dare to play At bowls, with such as my dead father is. And yet, this may be less so than appears, This change and separation. Sparrows five For just two farthings, and God cares for each. If God is not too great for little cares, Is any creature, because gone to God? Ive seen some men, veracious, nowise mad, Who have thought or dreamed, declared and testified, Theyve heard the Dead a-ticking like a clock Which strikes the hours of the eternities, Beside them, with their natural ears, and known That human spirits feel the human way, And hate the unreasoning awe which waves them off From possible communion. It may be. At least, earth separates as well as heaven. For instance, I have not seen Romney Leigh Full eighteen months,add six, you get two years. They say hes very busy with good works, Has parted Leigh Hall into almshouses. He made an almshouse of his heart one day, Which ever since is loose upon the latch For those who pull the string.—I never did. It always makes me sad to go abroad; And now I'm sadder that I went to-night Among the lights and talkers at Lord Howes. His wife is gracious, with her glossy braids, And even voice, and gorgeous eyeballs, calm As her other jewels. If shes somewhat cold, Who wonders, when her blood has stood so long In the ducal reservoir she calls her line By no means arrogantly? shes not proud; Not prouder than the swan is of the lake He has always swum in;—tis her element, And so she takes it with a natural grace, Ignoring tadpoles. She just knows, perhaps, There are men, move on without outriders, Which isnt her fault. Ah, to watch her face, When good Lord Howe expounds his theories Of social justice and equality— Tis curious, what a tender, tolerant bend Her neck takes: for she loves him, likes his talk, Such clever talk—that dear, odd Algernon! She listens on, exactly as if he talked Some Scandinavian myth of Lemures, Too pretty to dispute, and too absurd. Shes gracious to me as her husbands friend, And would be gracious, were I not a Leigh, Being used to smile just so, without her eyes, On Joseph Strangways, the Leeds mesmerist, And Delia Dobbs, the lecturer from the States Upon the Womans question. Then, for him, I like him,hes my friend. And all the rooms Were full of crinkling silks that swept about The fine dust of most subtle courtesies. What then?—why then, we come home to be sad. How lovely One I love not, looked to-night! Shes very pretty, Lady Waldemar. Her maid must use both hands to twist that coil Of tresses, then be careful lest the rich Bronze rounds should slip:—she missed, though, a grey hair, A single one, I saw it; otherwise The woman looked immortal. How they told, Those alabaster shoulders and bare breasts, On which the pearls, drowned out of sight in milk, Were lost, excepting for the ruby-clasp! They split the amaranth velvet-boddice down To the waist, or nearly, with the audacious press Of full-breathed beauty. If the heart within Were half as white!—but, if it were, perhaps The breast were closer covered, and the sight Less aspectable, by half, too. I heard The young man with the German students look— A sharp face, like a knife in a cleft stick, Which shot up straight against the parting line So equally dividing the long hair, Say softly to his neighbour, thirty-five And mediæval Look that way, Sir Blaise. Shes Lady Waldemar—to the left, in red— Whom Romney Leigh, our ablest man just now, Is soon about to marry. Then replied Sir Blaise Delorme, with quiet, priestlike voice, Too used to syllable damnations round To make a natural emphasis worth while: Is Leigh your ablest man? the same, I think, Once jilted by a recreant pretty maid Adopted from the people? Now, in change, He seems to have plucked a flower from the other side Of the social hedge, A flower, a flower, exclaimed My German student, his own eyes full-blown Bent on her. He was twenty, certainly. Sir Blaise resumed with gentle arrogance, As if he had dropped his alms into a hat, And had the right to counsel, My young friend, I doubt your ablest mans ability To get the least good or help meet for him, For pagan phalanstery or Christian home, From such a flowery creature, Beautiful! My student murmured, rapt, Mark how she stirs! Just waves her head, as if a flower indeed, Touched far off by the vain breath of our talk. At which that bilious Grimwald, he who writes For the Renovator who had seemed absorbed Upon the table-book of autographs, I dare say mentally he crunched the bones Of all those writers, wishing them alive To feel his tooth in earnest turned short round With low carnivorous laugh, A flower, of course! She neither sews nor spins, and takes no thought Of her garments,falling off. The student flinched, Sir Blaise, the same; then both, drawing back their chairs As if they spied black-beetles on the floor, Pursued their talk, without a word being thrown To the critic. Good Sir Blaises brow is high And noticeably narrow: a strong wind, You fancy, might unroof him suddenly, And blow that great top attic off his head So piled with feudal relics. You admire His nose in profile, though you miss his chin; But, though you miss his chin, you seldom miss His golden cross worn innermostly, carved For penance, by a saintly Styrian monk Whose flesh was too much with him, slipping through Some unaware unbuttoned casualty Of the under-waistcoat. With an absent air Sir Blaise sate fingering it and speaking low, While I, upon the sofa, heard it all. My dear young friend, if we could bear our eyes Like blessedest St. Lucy, on a plate, They would not trick us into choosing wives, As doublets, by the colour. Otherwise Our fathers chose, and therefore, when they had hung Their household keys about a ladys waist, The sense of duty gave her dignity: She kept her bosom holy to her babes; And, if a moralist reproved her dress, Twas, Too much starch!—and not, Too little lawn!' Now, pshaw! returned the other in a heat, A little fretted by being called young friend, Or so I took it, for St. Lucys sake, If shes the saint to curse by, let us leave Our fathers, plagued enough about our sons! He stroked his beardless chin yes, plagued, sir, plagued: The future generations lie on us As heavy as the nightmare of a seer; Our meat and drink grow painful prophecy: I ask you, have we leisure, if we liked, To hollow out our weary hands to keep Your intermittent rushlight of the past From draughts in lobbies? Prejudice of sex, And marriage-laws,the socket drops them through While we two speak, however may protest Some over-delicate nostrils, like your own, Gainst odours thence arising. You are young, Sir Blaise objected. If I am, he said With fire, though somewhat less so than I seem, The young run on before, and see the thing Thats coming. Reverence for the young, I cry. In that new church for which the worlds near ripe, Youll have the younger in the Elders chair, Presiding with his ivory front of hope Oer foreheads clawed by cruel carrion-birds Of lifes experience. Pray your blessing, sir, Sir Blaise replied good-humouredly, I plucked A silver hair this morning from my beard, Which left me your inferior. Would I were Eighteen, and worthy to admonish you! If young men of your order run before To see such sights as sexual prejudice And marriage-law dissolved, in plainer words, A general concubinage expressed In a universal pruriency, the thing Is scarce worth running fast for, and youd gain By loitering with your elders. Ah, he said, Who, getting to the top of Pisgah-hill, Can talk with one at bottom of the view, To make it comprehensible? Why, Leigh Himself, although our ablest man, I said, Is scarce advanced to see as far as this, Which some are: he takes up imperfectly The social question—by one handle—leaves The rest to trail. A Christian socialist, Is Romney Leigh, you understand. Not I. I disbelieve in Christian-pagans, much As you in women-fishes. If we mix Two colours, we lose both, and make a third Distinct from either. Mark you! to mistake A colour is the sign of a sick brain, And mine, I thank the saints, is clear and cool: A neutral tint is here impossible. The church, and by the church, I mean, of course, The catholic, apostolic, mother-church, Draws lines as plain and straight as her own wall; Inside of which, are Christians, obviously, And outside,dogs. We thank you. Well I know The ancient mother-church would fain still bite, For all her toothless gums, as Leigh himself Would fain be a Christian still, for all his wit; Pass that; you two may settle it, for me. Youre slow in England. In a month I learnt At Göttingen, enough philosophy To stock your English schools for fifty years; Pass that, too. Here, alone, I stop you short, —Supposing a true man like Leigh could stand Unequal in the stature of his life To the height of his opinions. Choose a wife Because of a smooth skin?—not he, not he! Hed rail at Venus self for creaking shoes, Unless she walked his way of righteousness: And if he takes a Venus Meretrix, No imputation on the lady there Be sure that, by some sleight of Christian art, He has metamorphosed and converted her To a Blessed Virgin. Soft! Sir Blaise drew breath As if it hurt him, Soft! no blasphemy, I pray you! The first Christians did the thing; Why not the last? asked he of Göttingen, With just that shade of sneering on the lip, Compensates for the lagging of the beard, And so the case is. If that fairest fair Is talked of as the future wife of Leigh, Shes talked of, too, at least as certainly, As Leighs disciple. You may find her name On all his missions and commissions, schools, Asylums, hospitals, he has had her down, With other ladies whom her starry lead Persuaded from their spheres, to his country-place In Shropshire, to the famed phalanstery At Leigh Hall, christianised from Fouriers own, In which he has planted out his sapling stocks Of knowledge into social nurseries And there, they say, she has tarried half a week, And milked the cows, and churned, and pressed the curd, And said my sister to the lowest drab Of all the assembled castaways; such girls! Ay, sided with them at the washing-tub— Conceive, Sir Blaise, those naked perfect arms, Round glittering arms, plunged elbow-deep in suds, Like wild swans hid in lilies all a-shake. Lord Howe came up. What, talking poetry So near the image of the unfavouring Muse? Thats you, Miss Leigh: Ive watched you half an hour, Precisely as I watched the statue called A Pallas in the Vatican;—you mind The face, Sir Blaise?—intensely calm and sad, As wisdom cut it off from fellowship, But that spoke louder. Not a word from you! And these two gentlemen were bold, I marked, And unabashed by even your silence. Ah, Said I, my dear Lord Howe, you shall not speak To a printing woman who has lost her place, The sweet safe corner of the household fire Behind the heads of children compliments, As if she were a woman. We who have clipt The curls before our eyes, may see at least As plain as men do: speak out, man to man; No compliments, beseech you. Friend to friend, Let that be. We are sad to-night, I saw, —Good night, Sir Blaise! Ah, Smith—he has slipped away I saw you across the room, and stayed, Miss Leigh, To keep a crowd of lion-hunters off, With faces toward your jungle. There were three; A spacious lady, five feet ten and fat, Who has the devil in her and theres room For walking to and fro upon the earth, From Chipewa to China; she requires Your autograph upon a tinted leaf Twixt Queen Pomares and Emperor Soulouques; Pray give it; she has energies, though fat: For me, Id rather see a rick on fire Than such a woman angry. Then a youth Fresh from the backwoods, green as the underboughs, Asks modestly, Miss Leigh, to kiss your shoe, And adds, he has an epic, in twelve parts, Which when youve read, youll do it for his boot, All which I saved you, and absorb next week Both manuscript and man, because a lord Is still more potent than a poetess, With any extreme republican. Ah, ah, You smile at last, then. Thank you. Leave the smile, Ill lose the thanks for t, ay, and throw you in My transatlantic girl, with golden eyes, That draw you to her splendid whiteness, as The pistil of a water-lily draws, Adust with gold. Those girls across the sea Are tyrannously pretty, and I swore She seemed to me an innocent, frank girl To bring her to you for a womans kiss, Not now, but on some other day or week: —Well call it perjury; I give her up. No, bring her. Now, said he, you make it hard To touch such goodness with a grimy palm. I thought to tease you well, and fret you cross, And steel myself, when rightly vexed with you, For telling you a thing to tease you more. Of Romney? No, no; nothing worse, he cried, Of Romney Leigh, than what is buzzed about, That he is taken in an eye-trap too, Like many half as wise. The thing I mean Refers to you, not him. Refers to me. He echoed, Me! You sound it like a stone Dropped down a dry well very listlessly, By one who never thinks about the toad Alive at the bottom. Presently perhaps Youll sound your me more proudly—till I shrink. Lord Howes the toad, then, in this question? Brief, Well take it graver. Give me sofa-room, And quiet hearing. You know Eglinton, John Eglinton, of Eglinton in Kent? Is he the toad?—hes rather like the snail; Known chiefly for the house upon his back: Divide the man and house—you kill the man; Thats Eglinton of Eglinton, Lord Howe. He answered grave. A reputable man, An excellent landlord of the olden stamp, If somewhat slack in new philanthropies; Who keeps his birthdays with a tenants dance, Is hard upon them when they miss the church Or keep their children back from catechism, But not ungentle when the aged poor Pick sticks at hedge-sides; nay, Ive heard him say, The old dame has a twinge because she stoops: Thats punishment enough for felony. O tender-hearted landlord! May I take My long lease with him, when the time arrives For gathering winter-faggots! He likes art, Buys books and pictures,of a certain kind; Neglects no patent duty; a good son  To a most obedient mother. Born to wear His fathers shoes, he wears her husbands too: Indeed, Ive heard its touching. Dear Lord Howe, You shall not praise me so against your heart, When I'm at worst for praise and faggots. Be Less bitter with me, for,in short, he said, I have a letter, which he urged me so To bring you,I could scarcely choose but yield; Insisting that a new love passing through The hand of an old friendship, caught from it Some reconciling perfume. Love, you say? My lord, I cannot love. I only find The rhymes for love, and thats not love, my lord. Take back your letter. Pause: youll read it first? I will not read it: it is stereotyped; The same he wrote to, anybodys name, Anne Blythe, the actress, when she had died so true, A duchess fainted in a private box: Pauline, the dancer, after the great pas, In which her little feet winked overhead Like other fire-flies, and amazed the pit: Or Baldinacci, when her F in alt Had touched the silver tops of heaven itself With such a pungent soul-dart, even the Queen Laid softly, each to each, her white-gloved palms, And sighed for joy: or else I thank your friend Aurora Leigh, when some indifferent rhymes, Like those the boys sang round the holy ox On Memphis-road, have chanced, perhaps, to set Our Apis-public lowing. Oh, he wants, Instead of any worthy wife at home, A star upon his stage of Eglinton! Advise him that he is not overshrewd In being so little modest: a dropped star Makes bitter waters, says a Book Ive read, And theres his unread letter. My dear friend, Lord Howe began  In haste I tore the phrase. You mean your friend of Eglinton, or me? I mean you, you, he answered with some fire. A happy life means prudent compromise; The tare runs through the farmers garnered sheaves; But though the gleaners apron holds pure wheat, We count her poorer. Tare with wheat, we cry, And good with drawbacks. You, you love your art, And, certain of vocation, set your soul On utterance. Only,in this world we have made, They say God made it first, but, if He did, Twas so long since,and, since, we have spoiled it so, He scarce would know it, if He looked this way, From hells we preach of, with the flames blown out, In this bad, twisted, topsy-turvy world, Where all the heaviest wrongs get uppermost, In this uneven, unfostering England here, Where ledger-strokes and sword-strokes count indeed, But soul-strokes merely tell upon the flesh They strike from, it is hard to stand for art, Unless some golden tripod from the sea Be fished up, by Apollos divine chance, To throne such feet as yours, my prophetess, At Delphi. Think, the god comes down as fierce As twenty bloodhounds! shakes you, strangles you, Until the oracular shriek shall ooze in froth! At best its not all ease, at worst too hard: A place to stand on is a vantage gained, And heres your tripod. To be plain, dear friend, Youre poor, except in what you richly give; You labour for your own bread painfully, Or ere you pour our wine. For arts sake, pause. I answered slow, as some wayfaring man, Who feels himself at night too far from home, Makes stedfast face against the bitter wind. Is art so less a thing than virtue is, That artists first must cater for their ease Or ever they make issue past themselves To generous use? alas, and is it so, That we, who would be somewhat clean, must sweep Our ways as well as walk them, and no friend Confirm us nobly, Leave results to God, But you, be clean? What! prudent compromise Makes acceptable life, you say instead, You, you, Lord Howe?—in things indifferent, well. For instance, compromise the wheaten bread For rye, the meat for lentils, silk for serge, And sleep on down, if needs, for sleep on straw; But there, end compromise. I will not bate One artist-dream, on straw or down, my lord, Nor pinch my liberal soul, though I be poor, Nor cease to love high, though I live thus low. So speaking, with less anger in my voice Than sorrow, I rose quickly to depart; While he, thrown back upon the noble shame Of such high-stumbling natures, murmured words, The right words after wrong ones. Ah, the man Is worthy, but so given to entertain Impossible plans of superhuman life, He sets his virtues on so raised a shelf, To keep them at the grand millennial height, He has to mount a stool to get at them; And, meantime, lives on quite the common way, With everybodys morals. As we passed, Lord Howe insisting that his friendly arm Should oar me across the sparkling brawling stream Which swept from room to room, we fell at once On Lady Waldemar. Miss Leigh, she said, And gave me such a smile, so cold and bright, As if she tried it in a tiring glass And liked it; all to-night Ive strained at you, As babes at baubles held up out of reach By spiteful nurses, Never snatch, they say, And there you sate, most perfectly shut in By good Sir Blaise and clever Mister Smith, And then our dear Lord Howe! at last, indeed, I almost snatched. I have a world to speak About your cousins place in Shropshire, where Ive been to see his work,our work, you heard I went? and of a letter, yesterday, In which, if I should read a page or two, You might feel interest, though youre locked of course In literary toil.—Youll like to hear Your last book lies at the phalanstery, As judged innocuous for the elder girls And younger women who still care for books. We all must read, you see, before we live: But slowly the ineffable light comes up, And, as it deepens, drowns the written word, So said your cousin, while we stood and felt A sunset from his favourite beech-tree seat: He might have been a poet if he would, But then he saw the higher thing at once, And climbed to it. I think he looks well now, Has quite got over that unfortunate,Ah, ah,I know it moved you. Tender-heart! You took a liking to the wretched girl. Perhaps you thought the marriage suitable, Who knows? a poet hankers for romance, And so on. As for Romney Leigh, tis sure He never loved her, never. By the way, You have not heard of her .? quite out of sight, And out of saving? lost in every sense? She might have gone on talking half-an-hour, And I stood still, and cold, and pale, I think, As a garden-statue a child pelts with snow For pretty pastime. Every now and then I put in yes or no, I scarce knew why; The blind man walks wherever the dog pulls, And so I answered. Till Lord Howe broke in; What penance takes the wretch who interrupts The talk of charming women? I, at last, Must brave it. Pardon, Lady Waldemar! The lady on my arm is tired, unwell, And loyally Ive promised she shall say No harder word this evening, than,goodnight; The rest her face speaks for her.—Then we went. And I breathe large at home. I drop my cloak, Unclasp my girdle, loose the band that ties My hair,now could I but unloose my soul! We are sepulchred alive in this close world, And want more room. The charming woman there— This reckoning up and writing down her talk Affects me singularly. How she talked To pain me! womans spite!—You wear steel-mail; A woman takes a housewife from her breast, And plucks the delicatest needle out As twere a rose, and pricks you carefully Neath nails, neath eyelids, in your nostrils, say, A beast would roar so tortured, but a man, A human creature, must not, shall not flinch, No, not for shame. What vexes, after all, Is just that such as she, with such as I, Knows how to vex. Sweet heaven, she takes me up As if she had fingered me and dog-eared me And spelled me by the fireside, half a life! She knows my turns, my feeble points.—What then? The knowledge of a thing implies the thing; Of course, she found that in me, she saw that, Her pencil underscored this for a fault, And I, still ignorant. Shut the book up! close! And crush that beetle in the leaves. O heart, At last we shall grow hard too, like the rest, And call it self-defence because we are soft. And after all, now,why should I be pained, That Romney Leigh, my cousin, should espouse This Lady Waldemar? And, say, she held Her newly-blossomed gladness in my face,Twas natural surely, if not generous, Considering how, when winter held her fast, I helped the frost with mine, and pained her more Than she pains me. Pains me!—but wherefore pained? Tis clear my cousin Romney wants a wife, So, good!—The mans need of the woman, here, Is greater than the womans of the man, And easier served; for where the man discerns A sex, ah, ah, the man can generalise, Said he we see but one, ideally And really: where we yearn to lose ourselves And melt like white pearls in anothers wine, He seeks to double himself by what he loves, And make his drink more costly by our pearls. At board, at bed, at work, and holiday, It is not good for man to be alone, And thats his way of thinking, first and last; And thus my cousin Romney wants a wife. But then my cousin sets his dignity On personal virtue. If he understands By love, like others, self-aggrandisement, It is that he may verily be great By doing rightly and kindly. Once he thought, For charitable ends set duly forth In Heavens white judgment-book, to marry,ah, Well call her name Aurora Leigh, although Shes changed since then!—and once, for social ends, Poor Marian Erle, my sister Marian Erle, My woodland sister, sweet maid Marian, Whose memory moans on in me like the wind Through ill-shut casements, making me more sad Than ever I find reasons for. Alas, Poor pretty plaintive face, embodied ghost, He finds it easy, then, to clap thee off From pulling at his sleeve and book and pen, He locks thee out at night into the cold, Away from butting with thy horny eyes Against his crystal dreams, that, now, hes strong To love anew? that Lady Waldemar Succeeds my Marian? After all, why not? He loved not Marian, more than once he loved Aurora. If he loves, at last, that Third, Albeit she prove as slippery as spilt oil On marble floors, I will not augur him Ill luck for that. Good love, howeer ill-placed, Is better for a mans soul in the end, Than if he loved ill what deserves love well. A pagan, kissing, for a step of Pan, The wild-goats hoof-print on the loamy down, Exceeds our modern thinker who turns back The strata,granite, limestone, coal, and clay, Concluding coldly with, Heres law! Wheres God? And then at worse, if Romney loves her not, At worst, if hes incapable of love, Which may be—then indeed, for such a man Incapable of love, shes good enough; For she, at worst too, is a woman still And loves him,as the sort of woman can. My loose long hair began to burn and creep, Alive to the very ends, about my knees: I swept it backward as the wind sweeps flame, With the passion of my hands. Ah, Romney laughed One day,how full the memories come up! —Your Florence fire-flies live on in your hair, He said, it gleams so. Well, I wrung them out, My fire-flies; made a knot as hard as life, Of those loose, soft, impracticable curls, And then sat down and thought  She shall not think Her thought of me, and drew my desk and wrote. Dear Lady Waldemar, I could not speak With people round me, nor can sleep to-night And not speak, after the great news I heard Of you and of my cousin. May you be Most happy; and the good he meant the world, Replenish his own life. Say what I say, And let my word be sweeter for your mouth, As you are you,I only Aurora Leigh. Thats quiet, guarded! though she hold it up Against the light, shell not see through it more Than lies there to be seen. So much for pride; And now for peace, a little! Let me stop All writing back  Sweet thanks, my sweetest friend, Youve made more joyful my great joy itself, —No, thats too simple! she would twist it thus, My joy would still be as sweet as thyme in drawers, However shut up in the dark and dry; But violets, aired and dewed by love like yours, Out-smell all thyme! we keep that in our clothes, But drop the other down our bosoms, till They smell like,ah, I see her writing back Just so. Shell make a nosegay of her words, And tie it with blue ribbons at the end To suit a poet;—pshaw! And then well have The call to church; the broken, sad, bad dream Dreamed out at last; the marriage-vow complete With the marriage-breakfast; praying in white gloves, Drawn off in haste for drinking pagan toasts In somewhat stronger wine than any sipped By gods, since Bacchus had his way with grapes. A postscript stops all that, and rescues me. You need not write. I have been overworked, And think of leaving London, England even, And hastening to get nearer to the sun, Where men sleep better. So, adieu.—I fold And seal, — and now I'm out of all the coil; I breathe now; I spring upward like a branch, A ten-years school-boy with a crooked stick May pull down to his level, in search of nuts, But cannot hold a moment. How we twang Back on the blue sky, and assert our height, While he stares after! Now, the wonder seems That I could wrong myself by such a doubt. We poets always have uneasy hearts; Because our hearts, large-rounded as the globe, Can turn but one side to the sun at once. We are used to dip our artist-hands in gall And potash, trying potentialities Of alternated colour, till at last We get confused, and wonder for our skin How nature tinged it first. Well—heres the true Good flesh-colour; I recognise my hand, Which Romney Leigh may clasp as just a friends, And keep his clean. And now, my Italy. Alas, if we could ride with naked souls And make no noise and pay no price at all, I would have seen thee sooner, Italy, For still I have heard thee crying through my life, Thou piercing silence of extatic graves, Men call that name! But even a witch, to-day, Must melt down golden pieces in the nard Wherewith to anoint her broomstick ere she rides; And poets evermore are scant of gold, And, if they find a piece behind the door, It turns by sunset to a withered leaf. The Devil himself scarce trusts his patented Gold-making art to any who make rhymes, But culls his Faustus from philosophers And not from poets. Leave my Job, said God; And so, the Devil leaves him without pence, And poverty proves, plainly, special grace. In these new, just, administrative times Men clamour for an order of merit. Why? Heres black bread on the table, and no wine! At least I am a poet in being poor; Thank God. I wonder if the manuscript Of my long poem, if twere sold outright, Would fetch enough to buy me shoes, to go A-foot, thrown in, the necessary patch For the other side the Alps? it cannot be: I fear that I must sell this residue Of my fathers books; although the Elzevirs Have fly-leaves over-written by his hand, In faded notes as thick and fine and brown As cobwebs on a tawny monument Of the old Greeks—conferenda hæc cum his— Corruptè citat—lege potiùs, And so on, in the scholars regal way Of giving judgment on the parts of speech, As if he sate on all twelve thrones up-piled, Arraigning Israel. Ay, but books and notes Must go together. And this Proclus too, In quaintly dear contracted Grecian types, Fantastically crumpled, like his thoughts Which would not seem too plain; you go round twice For one step forward, then you take it back, Because youre somewhat giddy! theres the rule For Proclus. Ah, I stained this middle leaf With pressing int my Florence iris-bell, Long stalk and all: my father chided me For that stain of blue blood, I recollect The peevish turn his voice took, Silly girls, Who plant their flowers in our philosophy To make it fine, and only spoil the book! No more of it, Aurora. Yes—no more! Ah, blame of love, thats sweeter than all praise Of those who love not! tis so lost to me, I cannot, in such beggared life, afford To lose my Proclus. Not for Florence, even. The kissing Judas, Wolff, shall go instead, Who builds us such a royal book as this To honour a chief-poet, folio-built, And writes above, The house of Nobody: Who floats in cream, as rich as any sucked From Junos breasts, the broad Homeric lines, And, while with their spondaic prodigious mouths They lap the lucent margins as babe-gods, Proclaims them bastards. Wolffs an atheist; And if the Iliad fell out, as he says, By mere fortuitous concourse of old songs, Well guess as much, too, for the universe. That Wolff, those Platos: sweep the upper shelves As clean as this, and so I am almost rich, Which means, not forced to think of being poor In sight of ends. To-morrow: no delay. Ill wait in Paris till good Carrington Dispose of such, and, having chaffered for My books price with the publisher, direct All proceeds to me. Just a line to ask His help. And now I come, my Italy, My own hills! Are you ware of me, my hills, How I burn toward you? do you feel to-night The urgency and yearning of my soul, As sleeping mothers feel the sucking babe And smile?—Nay, not so much as when, in heat, Vain lightnings catch at your inviolate tops, And tremble while ye are stedfast. Still, ye go Your own determined, calm, indifferent way Toward sunrise, shade by shade, and light by light; Of all the grand progression nought left out; As if God verily made you for yourselves, And would not interrupt your life with ours. SIXTH BOOK. The English have a scornful insular way Of calling the French light. The levity Is in the judgment only, which yet stands; For say a foolish thing but oft enough, And heres the secret of a hundred creeds, Men get opinions as boys learn to spell, By re-iteration chiefly the same thing Shall pass at last for absolutely wise, And not with fools exclusively. And so, We say the French are light, as if we said The cat mews, or the milch-cow gives us milk: Say rather, cats are milked, and milch-cows mew; For what is lightness but inconsequence, Vague fluctuation twixt effect and cause, Compelled by neither? Is a bullet light, That dashes from the gun-mouth, while the eye Winks, and the heart beats one, to flatten itself To a wafer on the white speck on a wall A hundred paces off? Even so direct, So sternly undivertible of aim, Is this French people. All, idealists Too absolute and earnest, with them all The idea of a knife cuts real flesh; And still, devouring the safe interval Which Nature placed between the thought and act, With those too fiery and impatient souls, They threaten conflagration to the world And rush with most unscrupulous logic on Impossible practice. Set your orators To blow upon them with loud windy mouths Through watchword phrases, jest or sentiment, Which drive our burley brutal English mobs Like so much chaff, whichever way they blow, This light French people will not thus be driven. They turn indeed; but then they turn upon Some central pivot of their thought and choice, And veer out by the force of holding fast. —Thats hard to understand, for Englishmen Unused to abstract questions, and untrained To trace the involutions, valve by valve, In each orbed bulb-root of a general truth, And mark what subtly fine integument Divides opposed compartments. Freedoms self Comes concrete to us, to be understood, Fixed in a feudal form incarnately To suit our ways of thought and reverence, The special form, with us, being still the thing. With us, I say, though I'm of Italy By mothers birth and grave, by fathers grave And memory; let it be, a poets heart Can swell to a pair of nationalities, However ill-lodged in a womans breast. And so I am strong to love this noble France, This poet of the nations, who dreams on And wails on while the household goes to wreck For ever, after some ideal good, Some equal poise of sex, some unvowed love Inviolate, some spontaneous brotherhood, Some wealth, that leaves none poor and finds none tired, Some freedom of the many, that respects The wisdom of the few. Heroic dreams! Sublime, to dream so; natural, to wake: And sad, to use such lofty scaffoldings, Erected for the building of a church, To build instead, a brothel,or a prison— May God save France! However she have sighed Her great soul up into a great mans face, To flush his temples out so gloriously That few dare carp at Cæsar for being bald, What then?—this Cæsar represents, not reigns, And is no despot, though twice absolute; This Head has all the people for a heart; This purples lined with the democracy, Now let him see to it! for a rent within Must leave irreparable rags without. A serious riddle: find such anywhere Except in France; and when its found in France, Be sure to read it rightly. So, I mused Up and down, up and down, the terraced streets, The glittering boulevards, the white colonnades Of fair fantastic Paris who wears boughs Like plumes, as if man made them, tossing up Her fountains in the sunshine from the squares, As dice i the game of beauty, sure to win; Or as she blew the down-balls of her dreams, And only waited for their falling back, To breathe up more, and count her festive hours. The city swims in verdure, beautiful As Venice on the waters, the sea-swan. What bosky gardens, dropped in close-walled courts, As plums in ladies laps, who start and laugh: What miles of streets that run on after trees, Still carrying the necessary shops, Those open caskets, with the jewels seen! And trade is art, and arts philosophy, In Paris. Theres a silk, for instance, there, As worth an artists study for the folds, As that bronze opposite! nay, the bronze has faults; Arts here too artful, conscious as a maid, Who leans to mark her shadow on the wall Until she lose a vantage in her step. Yet Art walks forward, and knows where to walk: The artists also, are idealists, Too absolute for nature, logical To austerity in the application of The special theory: not a soul content To paint a crooked pollard and an ass, As the English will, because they find it so, And like it somehow.—Ah, the old Tuileries Is pulling its high cap down on its eyes, Confounded, conscience-stricken, and amazed By the apparition of a new fair face In those devouring mirrors. Through the grate, Within the gardens, what a heap of babes, Swept up like leaves beneath the chestnut-trees, From every street and alley of the town, By the ghosts perhaps, that blow too bleak this way A-looking for their heads! Dear pretty babes; Ill wish them luck to have their ball-play out Before the next change comes.—And, farther on, What statues, poised upon their columns fine, As if to stand a moment were a feat, Against that blue! What squares! what breathing-room For a nation that runs fast, ay, runs against The dentists teeth at the corner, in pale rows, Which grin at progress in an epigram. I walked the day out, listening to the chink Of the first Napoleons dry bones, as they lay In his second grave beneath the golden dome That caps all Paris like a bubble. Shall These dry bones live, thought Louis Philippe once, And lived to know. Herein is argument For kings and politicians, but still more For poets, who bear buckets to the well, Of ampler draught. These crowds are very good For meditation, when we are very strong Though love of beauty makes us timorous, And draws us backward from the coarse town-sights To count the daisies upon dappled fields, And hear the streams bleat on among the hills In innocent and indolent repose; While still with silken elegiac thoughts We wind out from us the distracting world, And die into the chrysalis of a man, And leave the best that may, to come of us, In some brown moth. Be, rather, bold, and bear To look into the swarthiest face of things, For Gods sake who has made them. Seven days work; The last day shutting twixt its dawn and eve, The whole work bettered, of the previous six! Since God collected and resumed in man The firmaments, the strata, and the lights, Fish, fowl, and beast, and insect, all their trains Of various life caught back upon His arm, Reorganised, and constituted MAN, The microcosm, the adding up of works; Within whose fluttering nostrils, then, at last, Consummating Himself, the Maker sighed, As some strong winner at the foot-race sighs Touching the goal. Humanity is great; And, if I would not rather pore upon An ounce of common, ugly, human dust, An artisans palm, or a peasants brow, Unsmooth, ignoble, save to me and God, Than track old Nilus to his silver roots, And wait on all the changes of the moon Among the mountain-peaks of Thessaly, Until her magic crystal round itself For many a witch to see in—set it down As weakness, strength by no means. How is this, That men of science, osteologists And surgeons, beat some poets, in respect For nature, count nought common or unclean, Spend raptures upon perfect specimens Of indurated veins, distorted joints, Or beautiful new cases of curved spine; While we, we are shocked at natures falling off, We dare to shrink back from her warts and blains, We will not, when she sneezes, look at her, Not even to say God bless her? Thats our wrong; For that, she will not trust us often with Her larger sense of beauty and desire, But tethers us to a lily or a rose And bids us diet on the dew inside, Left ignorant that the hungry beggar-boy Who stares unseen against our absent eyes, And wonders at the gods that we must be, To pass so careless for the oranges! Bears yet a breastful of a fellow-world To this world, undisparaged, undespoiled, And while we scorn him for a flower or two, As being, Heaven help us, less poetical Contains, himself, both flowers and firmaments And surging seas and aspectable stars, And all that we would push him out of sight In order to see nearer. Let us pray Gods grace to keep Gods image in repute; That so, the poet and philanthropist, Even I and Romney may stand side by side, Because we both stand face to face with men Contemplating the people in the rough, Yet each so follow a vocation, his And mine. I walked on, musing with myself On life and art, and whether, after all, A larger metaphysics might not help Our physics, a completer poetry Adjust our daily life and vulgar wants, More fully than the special outside plans, Phalansteries, material institutes, The civil conscriptions and lay monasteries Preferred by modern thinkers, as they thought The bread of man indeed made all his life, And washing seven times in the Peoples Baths Were sovereign for a peoples leprosy, Still leaving out the essential prophets word That comes in power. On which, we thunder down, We prophets, poets, Virtues in the word! The maker burnt the darkness up with His, To inaugurate the use of vocal life; And, plant a poets word even, deep enough In any mans breast, looking presently For offshoots, you have done more for the man, Than if you dressed him in a broad-cloth coat And warmed his Sunday potage at your fire. Yet Romney leaves me  God! what face is that? O Romney, O Marian! Walking on the quays And pulling thoughts to pieces leisurely, As if I caught at grasses in a field, And bit them slow between my absent lips, And shred them with my hands  What face is that? What a face, what a look, what a likeness! Full on mine The sudden blow of it came down, till all My blood swam, my eyes dazzled. Then I sprang— It was as if a meditative man Were dreaming out a summer afternoon And watching gnats a-prick upon a pond, When something floats up suddenly, out there, Turns over,a dead face, known once alive— So old, so new! It would be dreadful now To lose the sight and keep the doubt of this. He plunges—ha! he has lost it in the splash. I plunged—I tore the crowd up, either side, And rushed on, forward, forward,after her. Her? whom? A woman sauntered slow, in front, Munching an apple, she left off amazed As if I had snatched it: thats not she, at least. A man walked arm-linked with a lady veiled, Both heads dropped closer than the need of talk: They started; he forgot her with his face, And she, herself, and clung to him as if My look were fatal. Such a stream of folk, And all with cares and business of their own! I ran the whole quay down against their eyes; No Marian; nowhere Marian. Almost, now, I could call Marian, Marian, with the shriek Of desperate creatures calling for the Dead. Where is she, was she? was she anywhere? I stood still, breathless, gazing, straining out In every uncertain distance, till, at last, A gentleman abstracted as myself Came full against me, then resolved the clash In voluble excuses, obviously Some learned member of the Institute Upon his way there, walking, for his health, While meditating on the last Discourse; Pinching the empty air twixt finger and thumb, From which the snuff being ousted by that shock, Defiled his snow-white waistcoat, duly pricked At the button-hole with honourable red; Madame, your pardon, there, he swerved from me A metre, as confounded as he had heard That Dumas would be chosen to fill up The next chair vacant, by his men in us. Since when was genius found respectable? It passes in its place, indeed, which means The seventh floor back, or else the hospital: Revolving pistols are ingenious things, But prudent men Academicians are Scarce keep them in the cupboard, next the prunes. And so, abandoned to a bitter mirth, I loitered to my inn. O world, O world, O jurists, rhymers, dreamers, what you please, We play a weary game of hide-and-seek! We shape a figure of our fantasy, Call nothing something, and run after it And lose it, lose ourselves too in the search; Till, clash against us, comes a somebody Who also has lost something and is lost, Philosopher against philanthropist, Academician against poet, man Against woman, against the living, the dead, Then home, with a bad headache and worse jest! To change the water for my heliotropes And yellow roses. Paris has such flowers. But England, also. Twas a yellow rose, By that south window of the little house, My cousin Romney gathered with his hand On all my birthdays for me, save the last; And then I shook the tree too rough, too rough, For roses to stay after. Now, my maps. I must not linger here from Italy Till the last nightingale is tired of song, And the last fire-fly dies off in the maize. My souls in haste to leap into the sun And scorch and seethe itself to a finer mood, Which here, in this chill north, is apt to stand Too stiffly in former moulds. That-face persists. It floats up, it turns over in my mind, As like to Marian, as one dead is like The same alive. In very deed a face And not a fancy, though it vanished so; The small fair face between the darks of hair, I used to liken, when I saw her first, To a point of moonlit, water down a well: The low brow, the frank space between the eyes, Which always had the brown pathetic look Of a dumb creature who had been beaten once, And never since was easy with the world. Ah, ah—now I remember perfectly Those eyes, to-day, how overlarge they seemed, As if some patient passionate despair Like a coal dropt and forgot on tapestry, Which slowly burns a widening circle out Had burnt them larger, larger. And those eyes To-day, I do remember, saw me too, As I saw them, with conscious lids astrain In recognition. Now, a fantasy, A simple shade or image of the brain, Is merely passive, does not retro-act, Is seen, but sees not. Twas a real face, Perhaps a real Marian. Which being so, I ought to write to Romney, Marians here. Be comforted for Marian. My pen fell, My hands struck sharp together, as hands do Which hold at nothing. Can I write to him A half truth? can I keep my own soul blind To the other half,the worse? What are our souls, If still, to run on straight a sober pace Nor start at every pebble or dead leaf, They must wear blinkers, ignore facts, suppress Six tenths of the road? Confront the truth, my soul! And oh, as truly as that was Marians face, The arms of that same Marian clasped a thing,Not hid so well beneath the scanty shawl, I cannot name it now for what it was. A child. Small business has a cast-away Like Marian, with that crown of prosperous wives, At which the gentlest she grows arrogant And says, my child. Wholl find an emerald ring On a beggars middle finger, and require More testimony to convict a thief? A childs too costly for so mere a wretch; She filched it somewhere; and it means, with her, Instead of honour, blessing,merely shame. I cannot write to Romney, Here she is, Heres Marian found! Ill set you on her track: I saw her here, in Paris,and her child. She put away your love two years ago, But, plainly, not to starve. You suffered then; And, now that youve forgot her utterly As any last years annual, in whose place Youve planted a thick flowering evergreen, I choose, being kind, to write and tell you this To make you wholly easy—shes not dead, But only,damned. Stop there: I go too fast; I'm cruel like the rest, in haste to take The first stir in the arras for a rat, And set my barking, biting thoughts upont. —A child! what then? Suppose a neighbours sick And asked her, Marian, carry out my child In this Spring air, I punish her for that? Or say, the child should hold her round the neck For good child-reasons, that he liked it so And would not leave her—she had winning ways— I brand her therefore, that she took the child? Not so. I will not write to Romney Leigh. For now hes happy, and she may indeed Be guilty, and the knowledge of her fault Would draggle his smooth time. But I, whose days Are not so fine they cannot bear the rain, And who, moreover, having seen her face, Must see it again,will see it, by my hopes Of one day seeing heaven too. The police Shall track her, hound her, ferret their own soil; Well dig this Paris to its catacombs But certainly well find her, have her out, And save her, if she will or will not—child Or no child, if a child, then one to save! The long weeks passed on without consequence. As easy find a footstep on the sand The morning after spring-tide, as the trace Of Marians feet between the incessant surfs Of this live flood. She may have moved this way, But so the star-fish does, and crosses out The dent of her small shoe. The foiled police Renounced me; Could they find a girl and child, No other signalment but girl and child? No data shown, but noticeable eyes And hair in masses, low upon the brow, As if it were an iron crown and pressed? Friends heighten, and suppose they specify: Why, girls with hair and eyes, are everywhere In Paris; they had turned me up in vain No Marian Erle indeed, but certainly Mathildes, Justines, Victoires,or, if I sought The English, Betsies, Saras, by the score. They might as well go out into the fields To find a speckled bean, thats somehow specked, And somewhere in the pod.—They left me so. Shall I leave Marian? have I dreamed a dream? —I thank God I have found her! I must say Thank God, for finding her, although tis true I find the world more sad and wicked fort. But she— Ill write about her, presently; My hands a-tremble as I had just caught up My heart to write with, in the place of it. At least youd take these letters to be writ At sea, in storm!—wait now  A simple chance Did all. I could not sleep last night, and, tired Of turning on my pillow and harder thoughts, Went out at early morning, when the air Is delicate with some last starry touch, To wander through the Market-place of Flowers The prettiest haunt in Paris, and make sure At worst, that there were roses in the world. So, wandering, musing, with the artists eye, That keeps the shade-side of the thing it loves, Half-absent, whole-observing, while the crowd Of young vivacious and black-braided heads Dipped, quick as finches in a blossomed tree, Among the nosegays, cheapening this and that In such a cheerful twitter of rapid speech, My heart leapt in me, startled by a voice That slowly, faintly, with long breaths that marked The interval between the wish and word, Inquired in strangers French, Would that be much, That branch of flowering mountain-gorse?—So much? Too much for me, then! turning the face round So close upon me, that I felt the sigh It turned with. Marian, Marian!—face to face— Marian! I find you. Shall I let you go? I held her two slight wrists with both my hands; Ah Marian, Marian, can I let you go? —She fluttered from me like a cyclamen, As white, which, taken in a sudden wind, Beats on against the palisade.—Let pass, She said at last. I will not, I replied; I lost my sister Marian many days, And sought her ever in my walks and prayers, And, now I find her,do we throw away The bread we worked and prayed for, crumble it And drop it,to do even so by thee Whom still Ive hungered after more than bread, My sister Marian?—can I hurt thee, dear? Then why distrust me? Never tremble so. Come with me rather, where well talk and live, And none shall vex us. Ive a home for you And me and no one else  She shook her head. A home for you and me and no one else Ill-suits one of us: I prefer to such, A roof of grass on which a flower might spring, Less costly to me than the cheapest here; And yet I could not, at this hour, afford A like home, even. That you offer yours, I thank you. You are good as heaven itself— As good as one I knew before  Farewell. I loosed her hands.—In his name, no farewell! She stood as if I held her. For his sake, For his sake, Romneys! by the good he meant, Ay, always! by the love he pressed for once, And by the grief, reproach, abandonment, He took in change  He, Romney! who grieved him? Who had the heart fort? what reproach touched him? Be merciful, speak quickly. Therefore come, I answered with authority, I think We dare to speak such things, and name such names, In the open squares of Paris! Not a word She said, but, in a gentle humbled way, As one who had forgot herself in grief Turned round and followed closely where I went, As if I led her by a narrow plank, Across devouring waters, step by step, And so in silence we walked on a mile. And then she stopped: her face was white as wax. We go much farther? You are ill, I asked, Or tired? She looked the whiter for her smile. Theres one at home, she said, has need of me By this time, and I must not let him wait. Not even, I asked, to hear of Romney Leigh? Not even, she said, to hear of Mister Leigh. In that case, I resumed, I go with you, And we can talk the same thing there as here. None waits for me: I have my day to spend. Her lips moved in a spasm without a sound, But then she spoke. It shall be as you please; And better so—tis shorter seen than told. And though you will not find me worth your pains, That even, may be worth some pains to know, For one as good as you are. Then she led The way, and I, as by a narrow plank Across devouring waters, followed her, Stepping by her footsteps, breathing by her breath, And holding her with eyes that would not slip; And so, without a word, we walked a mile, And so, another mile, without a word. Until the peopled streets being all dismissed, House-rows and groups all scattered like a flock, The market-gardens thickened, and the long White walls beyond, like spiders outside threads, Stretched, feeling blindly toward the country-fields Through half-built habitations and half-dug Foundations, intervals of trenchant chalk, That bite betwixt the grassy uneven turfs Where goats vine-tendrils trailing from their mouths Stood perched on edges of the cellarage Which should be, staring as about to leap To find their coming Bacchus. All the place Seemed less a cultivation than a waste: Men work here, only, scarce begin to live: Alls sad, the country struggling with the town, Like an untamed hawk upon a strong mans fist, That beats its wings and tries to get away, And cannot choose be satisfied so soon To hop through court-yards with its right foot tied, The vintage plains and pastoral hills in sight! We stopped beside a house too high and slim To stand there by itself, but waiting till Five others, two on this side, three on that, Should grow up from the sullen second floor They pause at now, to build it to a row. The upper windows partly were unglazed Meantime, a meagre, unripe house: a line Of rigid poplars elbowed it behind, And, just in front, beyond the lime and bricks That wronged the grass between it and the road, A great acacia, with its slender trunk And overpoise of multitudinous leaves, In which a hundred fields might spill their dew And intense verdure, yet find room enough Stood, reconciling all the place with green. I followed up the stair upon her step. She hurried upward, shot across a face, A womans on the landing, How now, now! Is no one to have holidays but you? You said an hour, and stay three hours, I think, And Julie waiting for your betters here? Why if he had waked, he might have waked, for me. —Just murmuring an excusing word she passed And shut the rest out with the chamber-door, Myself shut in beside her. Twas a room Scarce larger than a grave, and near as bare; Two stools, a pallet-bed; I saw the room: A mouse could find no sort of shelter int, Much less a greater secret; curtainless, The window fixed you with its torturing eye, Defying you to take a step apart, If peradventure you would hide a thing. I saw the whole room, I and Marian there Alone. Alone? She threw her bonnet off, Then sighing as twere sighing the last time, Approached the bed, and drew a shawl away: You could not peel a fruit you fear to bruise More calmly and more carefully than so, Nor would you find within, a rosier flushed Pomegranate— There he lay, upon his back, The yearling creature, warm and moist with life To the bottom of his dimples, to the ends Of the lovely tumbled curls about his face; For since he had been covered over-much To keep him from the light-glare, both his cheeks Were hot and scarlet as the first live rose The shepherds heart-blood ebbed away into, The faster for his love. And love was here As instant! in the pretty baby-mouth, Shut close as if for dreaming that it sucked; The little naked feet drawn up the way Of nestled birdlings; everything so soft And tender, to the little holdfast hands, Which, closing on a finger into sleep, Had kept the mould oft. While we stood there dumb, For oh, that it should take such innocence To prove just guilt, I thought, and stood there dumb; The light upon his eyelids pricked them wide, And, staring out at us with all their blue, As half perplexed between the angelhood He had been away to visit in his sleep, And our most mortal presence, gradually He saw his mothers face, accepting it In change for heaven itself, with such a smile As might have well been learnt there, never moved, But smiled on, in a drowse of ecstasy, So happy half with her and half with heaven He could not have the trouble to be stirred, But smiled and lay there. Like a rose, I said: As red and still indeed as any rose, That blows in all the silence of its leaves, Content, in blowing, to fulfil its life. She leaned above him drinking him as wine In that extremity of love, twill pass For agony or rapture, seeing that love Includes the whole of nature, rounding it To love,no more, since more can never be Than just love. Self-forgot, cast out of self, And drowning in the transport of the sight, Her whole pale passionate face, mouth, forehead, eyes, One gaze, she stood! then, slowly as he smiled, She smiled too, slowly, smiling unaware, And drawing from his countenance to hers A fainter red, as if she watched a flame And stood in it a-glow. How beautiful, Said she. I answered, trying to be cold. Must sin have compensations, was my thought, As if it were a holy thing like grief? And is a woman to be fooled aside From putting vice down, with that womans toy, A baby?—— Ay! the child is well enough, I answered. If his mothers palms are clean, They need be glad, of course, in clasping such: But if not, I would rather lay my hand, Were I she, on Gods brazen altar-bars Red-hot with burning sacrificial lambs, Than touch the sacred curls of such a child. She plunged her fingers in his clustering locks, As one who would not be afraid of fire; And then, with indrawn steady utterance, said, My lamb, my lamb! although, through such as thou, The most unclean got courage and approach To God, once, now they cannot, even with men, Find grace enough for pity and gentle words. My Marian, I made answer, grave and sad, The priest who stole a lamb to offer him, Was still a thief. And if a woman steals Through Gods own barrier-hedges of true love, Which fence out licence in securing love A child like this, that smiles so in her face, She is no mother, but a kidnapper, And hes a dismal orphan,not a son; Whom all her kisses cannot feed so full He will not miss hereafter a pure home To live in, a pure heart to lean against, A pure good mothers name and memory To hope by, when the world grows thick and bad, And he feels out for virtue. Oh, she smiled With bitter patience, the child takes his chance, Not much worse off in being fatherless Than I was, fathered. He will say, belike, His mother was the saddest creature born; Hell say his mother lived so contrary To joy, that even the kindest, seeing her, Grew sometimes almost cruel: hell not say She flew contrarious in the face of God With bat-wings of her vices. Stole my child, My flower of earth, my only flower on earth, My sweet, ray beauty!,Up she snatched the child, And, breaking on him in a storm of tears, Drew out her long sobs from their shivering roots, Until he took it for a game, and stretched His feet, and flapped his eager arms like wings, And crowed and gurgled through his infant laugh: Mine, mine, she said; I have as sure a right As any glad proud mother in the world, Who sets her darling down to cut his teeth Upon her church-ring. If she talks of law, I talk of law! I claim my mother-dues By law, the law which now is paramount; The common law, by which the poor and weak Are trodden underfoot by vicious men, And loathed for ever after by the good. Let pass! I did not filch,I found the child. You found him, Marian? Ay, I found him where I found my curse, in the gutter, with my shame! What have you, any of you, to say to that, Who all are happy, and sit safe and high, And never spoke before to arraign my right To grief itself? What, what,being beaten down By hoofs of maddened oxen into a ditch, Half-dead, whole mangled,when a girl, at last, Breathes, sees,and finds there, bedded in her flesh, Because of the overcoming shock perhaps, Some coin of price!. and when a good man comes Thats God! the best men are not quite as good And says, I dropped the coin there: take it, you, And keep it, it shall pay you for the loss, You all put up your finger—See the thief! Observe that precious thing she has come to filch! How bad those girls are! Oh, my flower, my pet, I dare forget I have you in my arms, And fly off to be angry with the world, And fright you, hurt you with my tempers, till You double up your lip? Ah, that indeed Is bad: a naughty mother! You mistake, I interrupted; if I loved you not, I should not, Marian, certainly be here. Alas, she said, you are so very good; And yet I wish, indeed, you had never come To make me sob until I vex the child. It is not wholesome for these pleasure-plats To be so early watered by our brine. And then, who knows? he may not like me now As well, perhaps, as ere he saw me fret, Ones ugly fretting! he has eyes the same As angels, but he cannot see as deep, And so Ive kept for ever in his sight A sort of smile to please him, as you place A green thing from the garden in a cup, To make believe it grows there. Look, my sweet, My cowslip-ball! weve done with that cross face, And heres the face come back you used to like. Ah, ah! he laughs! he likes me. Ah, Miss Leigh, Youre great and pure; but were you purer still, As if you had walked, well say, no otherwhere Than up and down the new Jerusalem, And held your trailing lutestring up yourself From brushing the twelve stones, for fear of some Small speck as little as a needle-prick, White stitched on white, the child would keep to me, Would choose his poor lost Marian, like me best, And, though you stretched your arms, cry back and cling, As we do, when God says its time to die And bids us go up higher. Leave us, then; We two are happy. Does he push me off? Hes satisfied with me, as I with him. So soft to one, so hard to others! Nay, I cried, more angry that she melted me, We make henceforth a cushion of our faults To sit and practise easy virtues on? I thought a child was given to sanctify A woman, set her in the sight of all The clear-eyed Heavens, a chosen minister To do their business and lead spirits up The difficult blue heights. A woman lives, Not bettered, quickened toward the truth and good Through being a mother? then shes none! although She damps her babys cheeks by kissing them, As we kill roses. Kill! O Christ, she said, And turned her wild sad face from side to side With most despairing wonder in it—What, What have you in your souls against me then, All of you? am I wicked, do you think? God knows me, trusts me with the child! but you, You think me really wicked? Complaisant, I answered softly, to a wrong youve done, Because of certain profits, which is wrong Beyond the first wrong, Marian. When you left The pure place and the noble heart, to take The hand of a seducer  Whom? whose hand? I took the hand of  Springing up erect, And lifting up the child at full arms length, As if to bear him like an oriflamme Unconquerable to armies of reproach, By him she said, my childs head and its curls, By those blue eyes no woman born could dare A perjury on, I make my mothers oath, That if I left that Heart, to lighten it, The blood of mine was still, except for grief! No cleaner maid than I was, took a step To a sadder end, no matron-mother now Looks backward to her early maidenhood Through chaster pulses. I speak steadily: And if I lie so,if, being fouled in will And paltered with in soul by devils lust, I dared to bid this angel take my part,Would God sit quiet, let us think, in heaven, Nor strike me dumb with thunder? Yet I speak: He clears me therefore. What, seduceds your word? Do wolves seduce a wandering fawn in France? Do eagles, who have pinched a lamb with claws, Seduce it into carrion? So with me. I was not ever, as you say, seduced, But simply, murdered. There she paused, and sighed, With such a sigh as drops from agony To exhaustion, sighing while she let the babe Slide down upon her bosom from her arms, And all her faces light fell after him, Like a torch quenched in falling. Down she sank, And sate upon the bedside with the child. But I, convicted, broken utterly, With womans passion clung about her waist, And kissed her hair and eyes, I have been wrong, Sweet Marian,weeping in a tender rage Sweet holy Marian! And now, Marian, now, Ill use your oath although my lips are hard, And by the child, my Marian, by the child, Ill swear his mother shall be innocent Before my conscience, as in the open Book Of Him who reads for judgement. Innocent, My sister! let the night be neer so dark, The moon is surely somewhere in the sky; So surely is your whiteness to be found Through all dark facts. But pardon, pardon me, And smile a little, Marian, for the child, If not for me, my sister. The poor lip Just motioned for the smile and let it go: And then, with scarce a stirring of the mouth, As if a statue spoke that could not breathe, But spoke on calm between its marble lips, I'm glad, I'm very glad you clear me so. I should be sorry that you set me down With harlots, or with even a better name Which misbecomes his mother. For the rest, I am not on a level with your love, Nor ever was, you know, but now am worse, Because that world of yours has dealt with me As when the hard sea bites and chews a stone And changes the first form of it. Ive marked A shore of pebbles bitten to one shape From all the various life of madrepores; And so, that little stone, called Marian Erle, Picked up and dropped by you and another friend, Was ground and tortured by the incessant sea And bruised from what she was, changed! deaths a change, And she, I said, was murdered; Marians dead. What can you do with people when they are dead, But, if you are pious, sing a hymn and go, Or, if you are tender, heave a sigh and go, But go by all means, and permit the grass To keep its green feud up twixt them and you? Then leave me, let me rest. I'm dead, I say. And if, to save the child from death as well, The mother in me has survived the rest, Why, thats Gods miracle you must not tax, I'm not less dead for that: I'm nothing more But just a mother. Only for the child, I'm warm, and cold, and hungry, and afraid, And smell the flowers a little, and see the sun, And speak still, and am silent, just for him! I pray you therefore to mistake me not, And treat me, haply, as I were alive; For though you ran a pin into my soul, I think it would not hurt nor trouble me. Heres proof, dear lady, in the market-place But now, you promised me to say a word About,a friend, who once, long years ago, Took Gods place toward me, when He draws and loves And does not thunder,whom at last I left, As all of us leave God. You thought perhaps, I seemed to care for hearing of that friend? Now, judge me! we have sate here half-an-hour And talked together of the child and me, And I not asked as much as, Whats the thing You had to tell me of the friend,the friend? Hes sad, I think you said, hes sick perhaps? Its nought to Marian if hes sad or sick. Another would have crawled beside your foot And prayed your words out. Why, a beast, a dog, A starved cat, if he had fed it once with milk, Would show less hardness. But I'm dead, you see, And that explains it. Poor, poor thing, she spoke And shook her head, as white and calm as frost On days too cold for raining any more, But still with such a face, so much alive, I could not choose but take it on my arm And stroke the placid patience of its cheeks, Then told my story out, of Romney Leigh, How, having lost her, sought her, missed her still, He, broken-hearted for himself and her, Had drawn the curtains of the world awhile As if he had done with morning. There I stopped, For when she gasped, and pressed me with her eyes, And now,how is it with him? tell me now, I felt the shame of compensated grief, And chose my words with scruple—slowly stepped Upon the slippery stones set here and there Across the sliding water. Certainly, As evening empties morning into night, Another morning takes the evening up With healthful, providential interchange; And, though he thought still of her, Yes, she knew, She understood: she had supposed, indeed, That, as one stops a hole upon a flute, At which a new note comes and shapes the tune, Excluding her would bring a worthier in, And, long ere this, that Lady Waldemar He loved so,Loved, I started, loved her so! Now tell me,I will tell you, she replied: But since were taking oaths, youll promise first That he, in England, he, shall never learn In what a dreadful trap his creature here, Round whose unworthy neck he had meant to tie The honourable ribbon of his name, Fell unaware, and came to butchery: Because, I know him, as he takes to heart The grief of every stranger, hes not like To banish mine as far as I should choose In wishing him most happy. Now he leaves To think of me, perverse, who went my way, Unkind, and left him, but if once he knew,Ah, then, the sharp nail of my cruel wrong Would fasten me for ever in his sight, Like some poor curious bird, through each spread wing Nailed high up over a fierce hunters fire, To spoil the dinner of all tenderer folk Come in by chance. Nay, since your Marians dead, You shall not hang her up, but dig a hole And bury her in silence! ring no bells. I answered gaily, though my whole voice wept; Well ring the joy-bells, not the funeral-bells, Because we have her back, dead or alive. She never answered that, but shook her head; Then low and calm, as one who, safe in heaven, Shall tell a story of his lower life, Unmoved by shame or anger, so she spoke. She told me she had loved upon her knees, As others pray, more perfectly absorbed In the act and aspiration. She felt his, For just his uses, not her own at all, His stool, to sit on, or put up his foot, His cup, to fill with wine or vinegar, Whichever drink might please him at the chance, For that should please her always: let him write His name upon her,it seemed natural; It was most precious, standing on his shelf, To wait until he chose to lift his hand. Well, well, I saw her then, and must have seen How bright her life went, floating on her love, Like wicks the housewives send afloat on oil, Which feeds them to a flame that lasts the night. To do good seemed so much his business, That, having done it, she was fain to think, Must fill up his capacity for joy. At first she never mooted with herself If he was happy, since he made her so, Or if he loved her, being so much beloved: Who thinks of asking if the sun is light, Observing that it lightens? whos so bold, To question God of His felicity? Still less. And thus she took for granted first, What first of all she should have put to proof, And sinned against him so, but only so. What could you hope, she said, of such as she? You take a kid you like, and turn it out In some fair garden; though the creatures fond And gentle, it will leap upon the beds And break your tulips, bite your tender trees: The wonder would be if such innocence Spoiled less. A garden is no place for kids. And, by degrees, when he who had chosen her, Brought in his courteous and benignant friends To spend their goodness on her, which she took So very gladly, as a part of his, By slow degrees, it broke on her slow sense, That she, too, in that Eden of delight Was out of place, and, like the silly kid, Still did most mischief where she meant most love. A thought enough to make a woman mad, No beast in this, but she may well go mad That, saying I am thine to love and use, May blow the plague in her protesting breath To the very man for whom she claims to die, That, clinging round his neck, she pulls him down And drowns him, and that, lavishing her soul, She hales perdition on him. So, being mad, Said Marian,Ah—who stirred such thoughts, you ask? Whose fault it was, that she should have such thoughts? Nones fault, nones fault. The light comes, and we see: But if it were not truly for our eyes, There would be nothing seen, for all the light; And so with Marian. If she saw at last, The sense was in her, Lady Waldemar Had spoken all in vain else. O my heart, O prophet in my heart, I cried aloud, Then Lady Waldemar spoke! Did she speak, Mused Marian softly—or did she only sign? Or did she put a word into her face And look, and so impress you with the word? Or leave it in the foldings of her gown, Like rosemary smells, a movement will shake out When no ones conscious? who shall say, or guess? One thing alone was certain, from the day The gracious lady paid a visit first, She, Marian, saw things different, felt distrust Of all that sheltering roof of circumstance Her hopes were building into with clay nests: Her heart was restless, pacing up and down And fluttering, like dumb creatures before storms, Not knowing wherefore she was ill at ease. And still the lady came, said Marian Erle, Much oftener than he knew it, Mister Leigh. She bade me never tell him that she had come, She liked to love me better than he knew, So very kind was Lady Waldemar: And every time she brought with her more light, And every light made sorrow clearer,Well, Ah, well! we cannot give her blame for that; Twould be the same thing if an angel came, Whose right should prove our wrong. And every time The lady came, she looked more beautiful, And spoke more like a flute among green trees, Until at last, as one, whose heart being sad On hearing lovely music, suddenly Dissolves in weeping, I brake out in tears Before her,asked her counsel,had I erred In being too happy? would she set me straight? For she, being wise and good and born above The flats I had never climbed from, could perceive If such as I, might grow upon the hills; And whether such poor herb sufficed to grow, For Romney Leigh to break his fast upon t, Or would he pine on such, or haply starve? She wrapt me in her generous arms at once, And let me dream a moment how it feels To have a real mother, like some girls: But when I looked, her face was younger,ay, Youths too bright not to be a little hard, And beauty keeps itself still uppermost, Thats true!—Though Lady Waldemar was kind, She hurt me, hurt, as if the morning-sun Should smite us on the eyelids when we sleep, And wake us up with headache. Ay, and soon Was light enough to make my heart ache too: She told me truths I asked for,twas my fault,That Romney could not love me, if he would, As men call loving; there are bloods that flow Together, like some rivers, and not mix, Through contraries of nature. He indeed Was set to wed me, to espouse my class, Act out a rash opinion, and, once wed, So just a man and gentle, could not choose But make my life as smooth as marriage-ring, Bespeak me mildly, keep me a cheerful house, With servants, broaches, all the flowers I liked, And pretty dresses, silk the whole year round,At which I stopped her, This for me. And now For him.—She murmured, truth grew difficult; She owned, Twas plain a man like Romney Leigh Required a wife more level to himself. If day by day he had to bend his height To pick up sympathies, opinions, thoughts, And interchange the common talk of life Which helps a man to live as well as talk, His days were heavily taxed. Who buys a staff To fit the hand, that reaches but the knee? Hed feel it bitter to be forced to miss The perfect joy of married suited pairs, Who, bursting through the separating hedge Of personal dues with that sweet eglantine Of equal love, keep saying, So we think, It strikes us, thats our fancy.—When I asked If earnest will, devoted love, employed In youth like mine, would fail to raise me up, As two strong arms will always raise a child To a fruit hung overhead? she sighed and sighed,That could not be, she feared. You take a pink, You dig about its roots and water it, And so improve it to a garden-pink, But will not change it to a heliotrope, The kind remains. And then, the harder truth— This Romney Leigh, so rash to leap a pale, So bold for conscience, quick for martyrdom, Would suffer steadily and never flinch, But suffer surely and keenly, when his class Turned shoulder on him for a shameful match, And set him up as nine-pin in their talk, To bowl him down with jestings.—There, she paused; And when I used the pause in doubting that We wronged him after all in what we feared— Suppose such things should never touch him, more In his high conscience, if the things should be, Than, when the queen sits in an upper room, The horses in the street can spatter her!— A moment, hope came, but the lady closed That door and nicked the lock, and shut it out, Observing wisely that, the tender heart Which made him over-soft to a lower class, Could scarcely fail to make him sensitive To a higher, how they thought, and what they felt. Alas, alas, said Marian, rocking slow The pretty baby who was near asleep, The eyelids creeping over the blue balls, She made it clear, too clear—I saw the whole! And yet who knows if I had seen my way Straight out of it, by looking, though twas clear, Unless the generous lady, ware of this, Had set her own house all a-fire for me, To light me forwards? Leaning on my face Her heavy agate eyes which crushed my will, She told me tenderly, as when men come To a bedside to tell people they must die She knew of knowledge, ay, of knowledge, knew, That Romney Leigh had loved her formerly; And she loved him, she might say, now the chance Was past,but that, of course, he never guessed, For something came between them,something thin As a cobweb,catching every fly of doubt To hold it buzzing at the window-pane And help to dim the daylight. Ah, mans pride Or womans—which is greatest? most averse To brushing cobwebs? Well, but she and he Remained fast friends; it seemed not more than so, Because he had bound his hands and could not stir: An honourable man, if somewhat rash; And she, not even for Romney, would she spill A blot,as little even as a tear,Upon his marriage-contract, not to gain A better joy for two than came by that! For, though I stood between her heart and heaven, She loved me wholly. Did I laugh or curse? I think I sate there silent, hearing all, Ay, hearing double, Marians tale, at once, And Romneys marriage-vow, Ill keep to thee, Which means that woman-serpent. Is it time For church now? Lady Waldemar spoke more, Continued Marian, but, as when a soul Will pass out through the sweetness of a song Beyond it, voyaging the uphill road, Even so, mine wandered from the things I heard, To those I suffered. It was afterward I shaped the resolution to the act. For many hours we talked. What need to talk? The fate was clear and close; it touched my eyes; But still the generous lady tried to keep The case afloat, and would not let it go, And argued, struggled upon Marians side, Which was not Romneys! though she little knew What ugly monster would take up the end, What griping death within the drowning death Was ready to complete my sum of death. I thought, Perhaps hes sliding now the ring Upon that womans finger  She went on: The lady, failing to prevail her way, Upgathered my torn wishes from the ground, And pieced them with her strong benevolence; And, as I thought I could breathe freer air Away from England, going without pause, Without farewell, just breaking with a jerk The blossomed offshoot from my thorny life, She promised kindly to provide the means, With instant passage to the colonies And full protection, would commit me straight To one who once had been her waiting-maid And had the customs of the world, intent On changing England for Australia Herself, to carry out her fortune so. For which I thanked the Lady Waldemar, As men upon their death-beds thank last friends Who lay the pillow straight: it is not much, And yet tis all of which they are capable, This lying smoothly in a bed to die. And so, twas fixed;—and so, from day to day, The woman named, came in to visit me. Just then, the girl stopped speaking, sate erect, And stared at me as if I had been a ghost, Perhaps I looked as white as any ghost With large-eyed horror. Does God make, she said, All sorts of creatures, really, do you think? Or is it that the Devil slavers them So excellently, that we come to doubt Whos strongest, He who makes, or he who mars? I never liked the womans face, or voice, Or ways: it made me blush to look at her; It made me tremble if she touched my hand; And when she spoke a fondling word, I shrank, As if one hated me, who had power to hurt; And, every time she came, my veins ran cold, As somebody were walking on my grave. At last I spoke to Lady Waldemar: Could such an one be good to trust? I asked. Whereat the lady stroked my cheek and laughed Her silver-laugh—one must be born to laugh, To put such music in it Foolish girl, Your scattered wits are gathering wool beyond The sheep-walk reaches!—leave the thing to me. And therefore, half in trust, and half in scorn That I had heart still for another fear In such a safe despair, I left the thing. The rest is short. I was obedient: I wrote my letter which delivered him From Marian, to his own prosperities, And followed that bad guide. The lady?—hush, I never blame the lady. Ladies who Sit high, however willing to look down, Will scarce see lower than their dainty feet: And Lady Waldemar saw less than I, With what a Devils daughter I went forth The swines road, headlong over a precipice, In such a curl of hell-foam caught and choked, No shriek of soul in anguish could pierce through To fetch some help. They say theres help in heaven For all such cries. But if one cries from hell,What then?—the heavens are deaf upon that side. A woman,hear me, let me make it plain, A woman,not a monster,both her breasts Made right to suckle babes,she took me off, A woman also, young and ignorant, And heavy with my grief, my two poor eyes Near washed away with weeping, till the trees, The blessed unaccustomed trees and fields, Ran either side the train, like stranger dogs Unworthy of any notice, took me off, So dull, so blind, and only half alive, Not seeing by what road, nor by what ship, Nor toward what place, nor to what end of all.— Men carry a corpse thus, past the doorway, past The garden-gate, the childrens playground, up The green lane, then they leave it in the pit, To sleep and find corruption, cheek to cheek With him who stinks since Friday. But suppose; To go down with ones soul into the grave, To go down half dead, half alive, I say, And wake up with corruption,cheek to cheek With him who stinks since Friday! There it is, And thats the horror of t, Miss Leigh. You feel? You understand?—no, do not look at me, But understand. The blank, blind, weary way Which led,whereer it led,away, at least; The shifted ship,to Sydney or to France,Still bound, wherever else, to another land; The swooning sickness on the dismal sea, The foreign shore, the shameful house, the night, The feeble blood, the heavy-headed grief,No need to bring their damnable drugged cup, And yet they brought it! Hells so prodigal Of devils gifts,hunts liberally in packs, Will kill no poor small creature of the wilds But fifty red wide throats must smoke at it, As HIS at me,when waking up at last,I told you that I waked up in the grave. Enough so!—it is plain enough so. True, We wretches cannot tell out all our wrong, Without offence to decent happy folk. I know that we must scrupulously hint With half-words, delicate reserves, the thing Which no one scrupled we should feel in full. Let pass the rest, then; only leave my oath Upon this sleeping child, mans violence, Not mans seduction, made me what I am, As lost as,I told him I should be lost; When mothers fail us, can we help ourselves? Thats fatal!—And you call it being lost, That down came next days noon and caught me there Half gibbering and half raving on the floor, And wondering what had happened up in heaven, That suns should dare to shine when God himself Was certainly abolished. I was mad, How many weeks, I know not, many weeks. I think they let me go, when I was mad, They feared my eyes and loosed me, as boys might A mad dog which they had tortured. Up and down I went by road and village, over tracts Of open foreign country, large and strange, Crossed everywhere by long thin poplar-lines Like fingers of some ghastly skeleton Hand Through sunlight and through moonlight evermore Pushed out from hell itself to pluck me back, And resolute to get me, slow and sure; While every roadside Christ upon his cross Hung reddening through his gory wounds at me, And shook his nails in anger, and came down To follow a mile after, wading up The low vines and green wheat, crying Take the girl! Shes none of mine from henceforth, Then, I knew, But this is somewhat dimmer than the rest The charitable peasants gave me bread And leave to sleep in straw: and twice they tied, At parting, Marys image round my neck— How heavy it seemed! as heavy as a stone; A woman has been strangled with less weight: I threw it in a ditch to keep it clean And ease my breath a little, when none looked; I did not need such safeguards:—brutal men Stopped short, Miss Leigh, in insult, when they had seen My face, I must have had an awful look. And so I lived: the weeks passed on, I lived. Twas living my old tramp-life oer again, But, this time, in a dream, and hunted round By some prodigious Dream-fear at my back Which ended, yet: my brain cleared presently, And there I sate, one evening, by the road, I, Marian Erle, myself, alone, undone, Facing a sunset low upon the flats, As if it were the finish of all time, The great red stone upon my sepulchre, Which angels were too weak to roll away. SEVENTH BOOK. The womans motive? shall we daub ourselves With finding roots for nettles? tis soft clay And easily explored. She had the means, The monies, by the ladys liberal grace, In trust for that Australian scheme and me, Which so, that she might clutch with both her hands, And chink to her naughty uses undisturbed, She served me after all it was not strange; Twas only what my mother would have done A motherly, unmerciful, good turn. Well, after. There are nettles everywhere, But smooth green grasses are more common still; The blue of heaven is larger than the cloud; A millers wife at Clichy took me in And spent her pity on me, made me calm And merely very reasonably sad. She found me a servants place in Paris where I tried to take the cast-off life again, And stood as quiet as a beaten ass Who, having fallen through overloads, stands up To let them charge him with another pack. A few months, so. My mistress, young and light, Was easy with me, less for kindness than Because she led, herself, an easy time Betwixt her lover and her looking-glass, Scarce knowing which way she was praised the most. She felt so pretty and so pleased all day She could not take the trouble to be cross, But, sometimes, as I stooped to tie her shoe, Would tap me softly with her slender foot, Still restless with the last nights dancing int, And say, Fie, pale-face! are you English girls All grave and silent? mass-book still, and Lent? And first-communion colours on your cheeks, Worn past the time fort? little fool, be gay! At which she vanished, like a fairy, through A gap of silver laughter. Came an hour When all went otherwise. She did not speak, But clenched her brows, and clipped me with her eyes As if a viper with a pair of tongs, Too far for any touch, yet near enough To view the writhing creature, then at last; Stand still there, in the holy Virgins name, Thou Marian; thourt no reputable girl, Although sufficient dull for twenty saints! I think thou mockst me and my house, she said; Confess, thoult be a mother in a month, Thou mask of saintship. Could I answer her? The light broke in so: it meant that then, that? I had not thought of that, in all my thoughts, Through all the cold, numb aching of my brow, Through all the heaving of impatient life Which threw me on death at intervals, through all The upbreak of the fountains of my heart The rains had swelled too large: it could mean that? Did God make mothers out of victims, then, And set such pure amens to hideous deeds? Why not? He overblows an ugly grave With violets which blossom in the spring. And I could be a mother in a month! I hope it was not wicked to be glad. I lifted up my voice and wept, and laughed, To heaven, not her, until it tore my throat. Confess, confess! what was there to confess, Except mans cruelty, except my wrong? Except this anguish, or this ecstasy? This shame, or glory? The light woman there Was small to take it in: an acorn-cup Would take the sea in sooner. Good, she cried; Unmarried and a mother, and she laughs! These unchaste girls are always impudent. Get out, intriguer! leave my house, and trot: I wonder you should look me in the face, With such a filthy secret. Then I rolled My scanty bundle up, and went my way, Washed white with weeping, shuddering head and foot With blind hysteric passion, staggering forth Beyond those doors. Twas natural, of course, She should not ask me where I meant to sleep; I might sleep well beneath the heavy Seine, Like others of my sort; the bed was laid For us. But any woman, womanly, Had thought of him who should be in a month, The sinless babe that should be in a month, And if by chance he might be warmer housed Than underneath such dreary, dripping eaves. I broke on Marian there. Yet she herself, A wife, I think, had scandals of her own, A lover, not her husband. Ay, she said, But gold and meal are measured otherwise; I learnt so much at school, said Marian Erle. O crooked world, I cried, ridiculous If not so lamentable! Its the way With these light women of a thrifty vice, My Marian, always hard upon the rent In any sisters virtue! while they keep Their chastity so darned with perfidy, That, though a rag itself, it looks as well Across a street, in balcony or coach, As any stronger stuff might. For my part, Id rather take the wind-side of the stews Than touch such women with my finger-end! They top the poor street-walker by their lie, And look the better for being so much worse: The devils most devilish when respectable. But you, dear, and your story. All the rest Is here, she said, and signed upon the child. I found a mistress-sempstress who was kind And let me sew in peace among her girls; And what was better than to draw the threads All day and half the night, for him, and him? And so I lived for him, and so he lives, And so I know, by this time, God lives too. She smiled beyond the sun, and ended so, And all my soul rose up to take her part Against the worlds successes, virtues, fames. Come with me, sweetest sister, I returned, And sit within my house, and do me good From henceforth, thou and thine! ye are my own From henceforth. I am lonely in the world, And thou art lonely, and the child is half An orphan. Come, and, henceforth, thou and I Being still together, will not miss a friend, Nor he a father, since two mothers shall Make that up to him. I am journeying south, And, in my Tuscan home Ill find a niche, And set thee there, my saint, the child and thee, And burn the lights of love before thy face, And ever at thy sweet look cross myself From mixing with the worlds prosperities; That so, in gravity and holy calm, We two may live on toward the truer life. She looked me in the face and answered not, Nor signed she was unworthy, nor gave thanks, But took the sleeping child and held it out To meet my kiss, as if requiting me And trusting me at once. And thus, at once, I carried him and her to where I lived; Shes there now, in the little room, asleep, I hear the soft child-breathing through the door; And all three of us, at to-morrows break, Pass onward, homeward, to our Italy. Oh, Romney Leigh, I have your debts to pay, And Ill be just and pay them. But yourself! To pay your debts is scarcely difficult; To buy your life is nearly impossible, Being sold away to Lamia. My head aches; I cannot see my road along this dark; Nor can I creep and grope, as fits the dark, For these foot-catching robes of womanhood: A man might walk a little,but I!—He loves The Lamia-woman, and I, write to him What stops his marriage, and destroys his peace, Or what, perhaps, shall simply trouble him, Until she only need to touch his sleeve With just a fingers tremulous white flame, Saying, Ah, Aurora Leigh! a pretty tale, A very pretty poet! I can guess The motive—then, to catch his eyes in hers, And vow she does not wonder, and they two To break in laughter, as the sea along A melancholy coast, and float up higher, In such a laugh, their fatal weeds of love! Ay, fatal, ay. And who shall answer me Fate has not hurried tides; and if to-night My letter would not be a night too late, An arrow shot into a man thats dead, To prove a vain intention? Would I show The new wife vile, to make the husband mad? No, Lamia! shut the shutters, bar the doors From every glimmer on thy serpent-skin! I will not let thy hideous secret out To agonise the man I love—I mean The friend I love,as friends love. It is strange, To-day while Marian told her story, like To absorb most listeners, how I listened chief To a voice not hers, nor yet that enemys, Nor Gods in wrath,but one that mixed with mine Long years ago, among the garden-trees, And said to me, to me too, Be my wife, Aurora! It is strange, with what a swell Of yearning passion, as snow of ghosts Might beat against the impervious doors of heaven, I thought, Now, if I had been a woman, such As God made women, to save men by love, By just my love I might have saved this man, And made a nobler poem for the world Than all I have failed in. But I failed besides In this; and now hes lost! through me alone! And, by my only fault, his empty house Sucks in, at this same hour, a wind from hell To keep his hearth cold, make his casements creak For ever to the tune of plague and sin— O Romney, O my Romney, O my friend! My cousin and friend! my helper, when I would, My love, that might be! mine! Why, how one weeps When ones too weary! Were a witness by, Hed say some folly,that I loved the man, Who knows? and make me laugh again for scorn. At strongest, women are as weak in flesh, As men, at weakest, vilest, are in soul: So, hard for women to keep pace with men! As well give up at once, sit down at once, And weep as I do. Tears, tears! why, we weep? Tis worth enquiry?—That weve shamed a life, Or lost a love, or missed a world, perhaps? By no means. Simply, that weve walked too far, Or talked too much, or felt the wind i the east, And so we weep, as if both body and soul Broke up in water—this way. Poor mixed rags Forsooth were made of, like those other dolls That lean with pretty faces into fairs. It seems as if I had a man in me, Despising such a woman. Yet indeed, To see a wrong or suffering moves us all To undo it, though we should undo ourselves; Ay, all the more, that we undo ourselves; Thats womanly, past doubt, and not ill-moved. A natural movement, therefore, on my part, To fill the chair up of my cousins wife, And save him from a devils company! Were all so, made so—tis our womans trade To suffer torment for anothers ease. The worlds male chivalry has perished out, But women are knights-errant to the last; And, if Cervantes had been greater still, He had made his Don a Donna. So it clears, And so we rain our skies blue. Put away This weakness. If, as I have just now said, A mans within me, let him act himself, Ignoring the poor conscious trouble of blood Thats called the woman merely. I will write Plain words to England, if too late, too late, If ill-accounted, then accounted ill; Well trust the heavens with something. Dear Lord Howe, Youll find a story on another leaf Thats Marian Erles, what noble friend of yours She trusted once, through what flagitious means To what disastrous ends;—the storys true. I found her wandering on the Paris quays, A babe upon her breast, unnatural Unseasonable outcast on such snows Unthawed to this time. I will tax in this Your friendship, friend, if that convicted She Be not his wife yet, to denounce the facts To himself, but, otherwise, to let them pass On tip-toe like escaping murderers, And tell my cousin, merely—Marian lives, Is found, and finds her home with such a friend, Myself, Aurora. Which good news, Shes found, Will help to make him merry in his love: I send it, tell him, for my marriage gift, As good as orange-water for the nerves, Or perfumed gloves for headaches, though aware That he, except of love, is scarcely sick; I mean the new love this time,since last year. Such quick forgetting on the part of men! Is any shrewder trick upon the cards To enrich them? pray instruct me how its done. First, clubs, and while you look at clubs, its spades; Thats prodigy. The lightning strikes a man, And when we think to find him dead and charred,Why, there he is on a sudden, playing pipes Beneath the splintered elm-tree! Crime and shame And all their hoggery trample your smooth world, Nor leave more foot-marks than Apollos kine, Whose hoofs were muffled by the thieving god In tamarisk-leaves and myrtle. I'm so sad, So weary and sad to-night, I'm somewhat sour, Forgive me. To be blue and shrew at once, Exceeds all toleration except yours; But yours, I know, is infinite. Farewell. To-morrow we take train for Italy. Speak gently of me to your gracious wife, As one, however far, shall yet be near In loving wishes to your house. I sign. And now Ill loose my heart upon a page, This— Lady Waldemar, I'm very glad I never liked you; which you knew so well, You spared me, in your turn, to like me much. Your liking surely had done worse for me Than has your loathing, though the last appears Sufficiently unscrupulous to hurt, And not afraid of judgment. Now, theres space Between our faces, I stand off, as if I judged a strangers portrait and pronounced Indifferently the type was good or bad: What matter to me that the lines are false, I ask you? Did I ever ink my lips By drawing your name through them as a friends, Or touch your hands as lovers do? thank God I never did: and, since youre proved so vile, Ay, vile, I say, well show it presently, I'm not obliged to nurse my friend in you, Or wash out my own blots, in counting yours, Or even excuse myself to honest souls Who seek to touch my lip or clasp my palm, Alas, but Lady Waldemar came first! Tis true, by this time, you may near me so That youre my cousins wife. Youve gambled deep As Lucifer, and won the morning-star In that case, and the noble house of Leigh Must henceforth with its good roof shelter you: I cannot speak and burn you up between Those rafters, I who am born a Leigh, nor speak And pierce your breast through Romneys, I who live His friend and cousin!—so, you are safe. You two Must grow together like the tares and wheat Till Gods great fire.—But make the best of time. And hide this letter! let it speak no more Than I shall, how you tricked poor Marian Erle, And set her own love digging her own grave Within her green hopes pretty garden-ground; Ay, sent her forth with some one of your sort To a wicked house in France, from which she fled With curses in her eyes and ears and throat, Her whole soul choked with curses, mad, in short, And madly scouring up and down for weeks The foreign hedgeless country, lone and lost, So innocent, male-fiends might slink within Remote hell-corners, seeing her so defiled! But you, you are a woman and more bold. To do you justice, youd not shrink to face,Well say, the unfledged life in the other room, Which, treading down Gods corn, you trod in sight Of all the dogs, in reach of all the guns, Ay, Marians babe, her poor unfathered child, Her yearling babe!—youd face him when he wakes And opens up his wonderful blue eyes: Youd meet them and not wink perhaps, nor fear Gods triumph in them and supreme revenge, So, righting His creations balance-scale You pulled as low as Tophet to the top Of most celestial innocence! For me Who am not as bold, I own those infant eyes Have set me praying. While they look at heaven, No need of protestation in my words Against the place youve made them! let them look! Theyll do your business with the heavens, be sure: I spare you common curses. Ponder this. If haply youre the wife of Romney Leigh, For which inheritance beyond your birth You sold that poisonous porridge called your soul I charge you, be his faithful and true wife! Keep warm his hearth and clean his board, and, when He speaks, be quick with your obedience; Still grind your paltry wants and low desires To dust beneath his heel; though, even thus, The ground must hurt him, it was writ of old, Ye shall not yoke together ox and ass, The nobler and ignobler. Ay, but you Shall do your part as well as such ill things Can do aught good. You shall not vex him, mark, You shall not vex him,jar him when hes sad, Or cross him when hes eager. Understand To trick him with apparent sympathies, Nor let him see thee in the face too near And unlearn thy sweet seeming. Pay the price Of lies, by being constrained to lie on still; Tis easy for thy sort: a million more Will scarcely damn thee deeper. Doing which, You are very safe from Marian and myself: Well breathe as softly as the infant here, And stir no dangerous embers. Fail a point, And show our Romney wounded, ill-content, Tormented in his home,we open mouth, And such a noise will follow, the last trumps Will scarcely seem more dreadful, even to you; Youll have no pipers after: Romney will I know him push you forth as none of his, All other men declaring it well done; While women, even the worst, your like, will draw Their skirts back, not to brush you in the street; And so I warn you. I'm,Aurora Leigh. The letter written, I felt satisfied. The ashes, smouldering in me, were thrown out By handfuls from me: I had writ my heart And wept my tears, and now was cool and calm; And, going straightway to the neighbouring room, I lifted up the curtains of the bed Where Marian Erle, the babe upon her arm, Both faces leaned together like a pair Of folded innocences, self-complete, Each smiling from the other, smiled and slept. There seemed no sin, no shame, no wrath, no grief. I felt, she too, had spoken words that night, But softer certainly, and said to God, Who laughs in heaven perhaps, that such as I Should make ado for such as she.—Defiled I wrote? defiled I thought her? Stoop, Stoop lower, Aurora! get the angels leave To creep in somewhere, humbly, on your knees, Within this round of sequestration white In which they have wrapt earths foundlings, heavens elect! The next day, we took train to Italy And fled on southward in the roar of steam. The marriage-bells of Romney must be loud, To sound so clear through all! I was not well; And truly, though the truth is like a jest, I could not choose but fancy, half the way, I stood alone i the belfry, fifty bells Of naked iron, mad with merriment, As one who laughs and cannot stop himself All clanking at me, in me, over me, Until I shrieked a shriek I could not hear, And swooned with noise, but still, along my swoon, Was ware the baffled changes backward rang, Prepared, at each emerging sense, to beat And crash it out with clangour. I was weak; I struggled for the posture of my soul In upright consciousness of place and time, But evermore, twixt waking and asleep, Slipped somehow, staggered, caught at Marians eyes A moment, it is very good for strength To know that some one needs you to be strong And so recovered what I called myself, For that time. I just knew it when we swept Above the old roofs of Dijon. Lyons dropped A spark into the night, half trodden out Unseen. But presently the winding Rhone Washed out the moonlight large along his banks, Which strained their yielding curves out clear and clean To hold it, shadow of town and castle blurred Upon the hurrying river. Such an air Blew thence upon the forehead, half an air And half a water, that I leaned and looked; Then, turning back on Marian, smiled to mark That she looked only on her child, who slept, His face towards the moon too. So we passed The liberal open country and the close, And shot through tunnels, like a lightning-wedge By great Thor-hammers driven through the rock, Which, quivering through the intestine blackness, splits, And lets it in at once: the train swept in Athrob with effort, trembling with resolve, The fierce denouncing whistle wailing on And dying off smothered in the shuddering dark, While we, self-awed, drew troubled breath, oppressed As other Titans, underneath the pile And nightmare of the mountains. Out, at last, To catch the dawn afloat upon the land! —Hills, slung forth broadly and gauntly everywhere, Not crampt in their foundations, pushing wide Rich outspreads of the vineyards and the corn, As if they entertained i the name of France While, down their straining sides, streamed manifest A soil as red as Charlemagnes knightly blood, To consecrate the verdure. Some one said, Marseilles! And lo, the city of Marseilles, With all her ships behind her, and beyond, The scimitar of ever-shining sea, For right-hand use, bared blue against the sky! That night we spent between the purple heaven And purple water: I think Marian slept; But I, as a dog a-watch for his masters foot, Who cannot sleep or eat before he hears, I sate upon the deck and watched all night, And listened through the stars for Italy. Those marriage-bells I spoke of, sounded far, As some childs go-cart in the street beneath To a dying man who will not pass the day, And knows it, holding by a hand he loves. I, too, sate quiet, satisfied with death, Sate silent: I could hear my own soul speak, And had my friend, for Nature comes sometimes And says, I am ambassador for God. I felt the wind soft from the land of souls; The old miraculous mountains heaved in sight, One straining past another along the shore, The way of grand dull Odyssean ghosts Athirst to drink the cool blue wine of seas And stare on voyagers. Peak pushing peak They stood: I watched beyond that Tyrian belt Of intense sea betwixt them and the ship, Down all their sides the misty olive-woods Dissolving in the weak congenial moon, And still disclosing some brown convent-tower That seems as if it grew from some brown rock, Or many a little lighted village, dropt Like a fallen star, upon so high a point, You wonder what can keep it in its place From sliding headlong with the waterfalls Which drop and powder all the myrtle-groves With spray of silver. Thus my Italy Was stealing on us. Genoa broke with day; The Dorias long pale palace striking out, From green hills in advance of the white town, A marble finger dominant to ships, Seen glimmering through the uncertain grey of dawn. But then I did not think, my Italy, I thought, my father! O my fathers house, Without his presence!—Places are too much Or else too little, for immortal man; Too little, when loves May oergrows the ground, Too much, when that luxuriant wealth of green Is rustling to our ankles in dead leaves. Tis only good to be, or here or there, Because we had a dream on such a stone, Or this or that, but, once beings wholly waked, And come back to the stone without the dream, We trip upont, alas! and hurt ourselves; Or else it falls on us and grinds us flat, The heaviest grave-stone on this burying earth. —But while I stood and mused, a quiet touch Fell light upon my arm, and, turning round, A pair of moistened eyes convicted mine. What, Marian! is the babe astir so soon? He sleeps, she answered; I have crept up thrice, And seen you sitting, standing, still at watch. I thought it did you good till now, but now,But now, I said, you leave the child alone. And youre alone, she answered, and she looked As if I, too, were something. Sweet the help Of one we have helped! Thanks, Marian, for that help. I found a house, at Florence, on the hill Of Bellosguardo. Tis a tower that keeps A post of double-observation oer The valley of Arno holding as a hand The outspread city straight toward Fiesole And Mount Morello and the setting sun, The Vallombrosan mountains to the right, Which sunrise fills as full as crystal cups Wine-filled, and red to the brim because its red. No sun could die, nor yet be born, unseen By dwellers at my villa: morn and eve Were magnified before us in the pure Illimitable space and pause of sky, Intense as angels garments blanched with God, Less blue than radiant. From the outer wall Of the garden, dropped the mystic floating grey Of olive-trees, with interruptions green From maize and vine until twas caught and torn On that abrupt black line of cypresses Which signed the way to Florence. Beautiful The city lay along the ample vale, Cathedral, tower and palace, piazza and street; The river trailing like a silver cord Through all, and curling loosely, both before And after, over the whole stretch of land Sown whitely up and down its opposite slopes, With farms and villas. Many weeks had passed, No word was granted.—Last, a letter came From Vincent Carrington:—My dear Miss Leigh, Youve been as silent as a poet should, When any other man is sure to speak. If sick, if vexed, if dumb, a silver-piece Will split a mans tongue, straight he speaks and says, Received that cheque. But you!. I send you funds To Paris, and you make no sign at all. Remember I'm responsible and wait A sign of you, Miss Leigh. Meantime your book Is eloquent as if you were not dumb; And common critics, ordinarily deaf To such fine meanings, and, like deaf men, loth To seem deaf, answering chance-wise, yes or no, It must be, or it must not, most pronounced When least convinced pronounce for once aright: Youd think they really heard, and so they do,The burr of three or four who really hear And praise your book aright: Fames smallest trump Is a great ear-trumpet for the deaf as posts, No other being effective. Fear not, friend; We think, here, you have written a good book, And you, a woman! It was in you—yes, I felt twas in you: yet I doubted half If that od-force of German Reichenbach Which still from female finger-tips burns blue, Could strike out, as our masculine white heats, To quicken a man. Forgive me. All my heart Is quick with yours, since, just a fortnight since, I read your book and loved it. Will you love My wife, too? Heres my secret, I might keep A month more from you! but I yield it up Because I know youll write the sooner fort, Most women of your height even counting love Lifes only serious business. Whos my wife That shall be in a month? you ask? nor guess? Remember what a pair of topaz eyes You once detected, turned against the wall, That morning, in my London painting-room; The face half-sketched, and slurred; the eyes alone! But you,you caught them up with yours, and said Kate Wards eyes, surely.—Now, I own the truth, I had thrown them there to keep them safe from Jove; They would so naughtily find out their way To both the heads of both my Danaës, Where just it made me mad to look at them. Such eyes! I could not paint or think of eyes But those, and so I flung them into paint And turned them to the walls care. Ay, but now Ive let them out, my Kates! Ive painted her, Ill change my style, and leave mythologies The whole sweet face; it looks upon my soul Like a face on water, to beget itself. A half-length portrait, in a hanging cloak Like one you wore once; tis a little frayed; I pressed, too, for the nude harmonious arm— But she,shed have her way, and have her cloak; She said she could be like you only so, And would not miss the fortune. Ah, my friend, Youll write and say she shall not miss your love Through meeting mine? in faith, she would not change: She has your books by heart, more than my words, And quotes you up against me till I'm pushed Where, three months since, her eyes were! nay, in fact, Nought satisfied her but to make me paint Your last book folded in her dimpled hands, Instead of my brown palette, as I wished, And, grant me, the presentment had been newer Shed grant me nothing: Ive compounded for The naming of the wedding-day next month, And gladly too. Tis pretty, to remark How women can love women of your sort, And tie their hearts with love-knots to your feet, Grow insolent about you against men, And put us down by putting up the lip, As if a man, there are such, let us own, Who write not ill, remains a man, poor wretch, While you——! Write far worse than Aurora Leigh, And therell be women who believe of you Besides my Kate that if you walked on sand You would not leave a foot-print. Are you put To wonder by my marriage, like poor Leigh? Kate Ward! he said. Kate Ward! he said anew. I thought,he said, and stopped, I did not think  And then he dropped to silence. Ah, hes changed. I had not seen him, youre aware, for long, But went of course. I have not touched on this Through all this letter, conscious of your heart, And writing lightlier for the heavy fact, As clocks are voluble with lead. How weak, To say I'm sorry. Dear Leigh, dearest Leigh! In those old days of Shropshire, pardon me, When he and you fought many a field of gold On what you should do, or you should not do, Make bread or verses, it just came to that I thought youd one day draw a silken peace Through a golden ring. I thought so. Foolishly, The event proved, for you went more opposite To each other, month by month, and year by year, Until this happened. God knows best, we say, But hoarsely. When the fever took him first, Just after I had writ to you in France, They tell me Lady Waldemar mixed drinks And counted grains, like any salaried nurse, Excepting that she wept too. Then Lord Howe, Youre right about Lord Howe! Lord Howes a trump; And yet, with such in his hand, a man like Leigh May lose, as he does. Theres an end to all, Yes, even this letter, though the second sheet May find you doubtful. Write a word for Kate: Even now she reads my letters like a wife, And, if she sees her name, Ill see her smile, And share the luck. So, bless you, friend of two! I will not ask you what your feeling is At Florence, with my pictures. I can hear Your heart a-flutter over the snow-hills; And, just to pace the Pitti with you once, Id give a half-hour of to-morrows walk With Kate,I think so. Vincent Carrington. The noon was hot; the air scorched like the sun, And was shut out. The closed persiani threw Their long-scored shadows on my villa-floor, And interlined the golden atmosphere Straight, still, across the pictures on the wall, The statuette on the console, of young Love And Psyche made one marble by a kiss The low couch where I leaned, the table near, The vase of lilies, Marian pulled last night, Each green leaf and each white leaf ruled in black As if for writing some new text of fate And the open letter, rested on my knee, But there, the lines swerved, trembled, though I sate Untroubled,plainly,reading it again And three times. Well, hes married; that is clear. No wonder that hes married, nor much more That Vincents therefore, sorry. Why, of course, The lady nursed him when he was not well, Mixed drinks, unless nepenthe was the drink, Twas scarce worth telling. But a man in love Will see the whole sex in his mistress hood, The prettier for its lining of fair rose; Although he catches back, and says at last, I'm sorry. Sorry. Lady Waldemar At prettiest, under the said hood, preserved From such a light as I could hold to her face To flare its ugly wrinkles out to shame, Is scarce a wife for Romney, as friends judge, Aurora Leigh, or Vincent Carrington, Thats plain. And if hes conscious of my heart,Perhaps its natural, though the phrase is strong; Ones apt to use strong phrases, being in love And even that stuff of fields of gold, gold rings, And what he thought, poor Vincent! what he thought, May never mean enough to ruffle me. —Why, this room stifles. Better burn than choke; Best have air, air, although it comes with fire, Throw open blinds and windows to the noon And take a blister on my brow instead Of this dead weight! best, perfectly be stunned By those insufferable cicale, sick And hoarse with rapture of the summer-heat, That sing like poets, till their hearts break,sing Till men say, Its too tedious. Books succeed, And lives fail. Do I feel it so, at last? Kate loves a worn-out cloak for being like mine, While I live self-despised for being myself, And yearn toward some one else, who yearns away From what he is, in his turn. Strain a step For ever, yet gain no step? Are we such, We cannot, with our admirations even, Our tip-toe aspirations, touch a thing Thats higher than we? is all a dismal flat, And God alone above each, as the sun Oer level lagunes, to make them shine and stink, Laying stress upon us with immediate flame, While we respond with our miasmal fog, And call it mounting higher, because we grow More highly fatal? Tush, Aurora Leigh! You wear your sackcloth looped in Cæsars way, And brag your failings as mankinds. Be still. There is whats higher, in this very world, Than you can live, or catch at. Stand aside, And look at others—instance little Kate! Shell make a perfect wife for Carrington. She always has been looking round the earth For something good and green to alight upon And nestle into, with those soft-winged eyes Subsiding now beneath his manly hand Twixt trembling lids of inexpressive joy: I will not scorn her, after all, too much, That so much she should love me. A wise man Can pluck a leaf, and find a lecture in t; And I, too,God has made me, Ive a heart Thats capable of worship, love, and loss; We say the same of Shakspeares. Ill be meek, And learn to reverence, even this poor myself. The book, too—pass it. A good book, says he, And you a woman. I had laughed at that, But long since. I'm a woman, it is true; Alas, and woe to us, when we feel it most! Then, least care have we for the crowns and goals, And compliments on writing our good books. The book has some truth in it, I believe: And truth outlives pain, as the soul does life. I know we talk our Phædons to the end Through all the dismal faces that we make, Oer-wrinkled with dishonouring agony From any mortal drug. I have written truth, And I a woman; feebly, partially, Inaptly in presentation, Romneyll add, Because a woman. For the truth itself, Thats neither mans nor womans, but just Gods; None else has reason to be proud of truth: Himself will see it sifted, disenthralled, And kept upon the height and in the light, As far as, and no farther, than tis truth; For, now He has left off calling firmaments And strata, flowers and creatures, very good, He says it still of truth, which is His own. Truth, so far, in my book;—the truth which draws Through all things upwards; that a twofold world Must go to a perfect cosmos. Natural things And spiritual, who separates those two In art, in morals, or the social drift, Tears up the bond of nature and brings death, Paints futile pictures, writes unreal verse, Leads vulgar days, deals ignorantly with men, Is wrong, in short, at all points. We divide This apple of life, and cut it through the pips, The perfect round which fitted Venus hand Has perished utterly as if we ate Both halves. Without the spiritual, observe, The naturals impossible;—no form, No motion! Without sensuous, spiritual Is inappreciable;—no beauty or power! And in this twofold sphere the twofold man And still the artist is intensely a man Holds firmly by the natural, to reach The spiritual beyond it, fixes still The type with mortal vision, to pierce through, With eyes immortal, to the antetype Some call the ideal, better called the real, And certain to be called so presently When things shall have their names. Look long enough On any peasants face here, coarse and lined, Youll catch Antinous somewhere in that clay, As perfect-featured as he yearns at Rome From marble pale with beauty; then persist, And, if your apprehensions competent, Youll find some fairer angel at his back, As much exceeding him, as he the boor, And pushing him with empyreal disdain For ever out of sight. Ay, Carrington Is glad of such a creed! an artist must, Who paints a tree, a leaf, a common stone, With just his hand, and finds it suddenly A-piece with and conterminous to his soul. Why else do these things move him, leaf or stone? The birds not moved, that pecks at a spring-shoot; Nor yet the horse, before a quarry, a-graze: But man, the two-fold creature, apprehends The two-fold manner, in and outwardly, And nothing in the world comes single to him, A mere itself, cup, column, or candlestick, All patterns of what shall be in the Mount; The whole temporal show related royally, And built up to eterne significance Through the open arms of God. Theres nothing great Nor small, has said a poet of our day, Whose voice will ring beyond the curfew of eve And not be thrown out by the matins bell And truly, I reiterate,nothings small! No lily-muffled hum of a summer-bee, But finds some coupling with the spinning stars; No pebble at your foot, but proves a sphere; No chaffinch, but implies the cherubim: And, glancing on my own thin, veinéd wrist, In such a little tremour of the blood The whole strong clamour of a vehement soul Doth utter itself distinct. Earths crammed with heaven, And every common bush afire with God: But only he who sees, takes off his shoes; The rest sit round it, and pluck blackberries, And daub their natural faces unaware More and more, from the first similitude. Truth, so far, in my book! a truth which draws From all things upwards. I, Aurora, still Have felt it hound me through the wastes of life As Jove did Io: and, until that Hand Shall overtake me wholly, and, on my head, Lay down its large unfluctuating peace, The feverish gad-fly pricks me up and down, It must be. Arts the witness of what Is Behind this show. If this worlds show were all, Then imitation would be all in Art; There, Joves hand gripes us!—For we stand here, we, If genuine artists, witnessing for Gods Complete, consummate, undivided work: —That not a natural flower can grow on earth, Without a flower upon the spiritual side, Substantial, archetypal, all a-glow With blossoming causes, not so far away, That we, whose spirit-sense is somewhat cleared, May not catch something of the bloom and breath, Too vaguely apprehended, though indeed Still apprehended, consciously or not, And still transferred to picture, music, verse, For thrilling audient and beholding souls By signs and touches which are known to souls, How known, they know not, why, they cannot find, So straight call out on genius, say, A man Produced this, when much rather they should say, Tis insight, and he saw this. Thus is Art Self-magnified in magnifying a truth Which, fully recognised, would change the world And shift its morals. If a man could feel, Not one day, in the artists ecstasy, But every day, feast, fast, or working-day, The spiritual significance burn through The hieroglyphic of material shows, Henceforward he would paint the globe with wings, And reverence fish and fowl, the bull, the tree, And even his very body as a man, Which now he counts so vile, that all the towns Make offal of their daughters for its use On summer-nights, when God is sad in heaven To think what goes on in his recreant world He made quite other; while that moon He made To shine there, at the first loves covenant, Shines still, convictive as a marriage-ring Before adulterous eyes. How sure it is, That, if we say a true word, instantly We feel tis Gods, not ours, and pass it on As bread at sacrament, we taste and pass Nor handle for a moment, as indeed We dared to set up any claim to such! And I—my poem;—let my readers talk; I'm closer to it—I can speak as well: Ill say, with Romney, that the book is weak, The range uneven, the points of sight obscure, The music interrupted. Let us go. The end of woman or of man, I think Is not a book. Alas, the best of books Is but a word in Art, which soon grows cramped, Stiff, dubious-statured with the weight of years, And drops an accent or digamma down Some cranny of unfathomable time, Beyond the critics reaching. Art itself, Weve called the higher life, still must feel the soul Live past it. For mores felt than is perceived, And mores perceived than can be interpreted, And Love strikes higher with his lambent flame Than Art can pile the faggots. Is it so? When Joves hand meets us with composing touch, And when, at last, we are hushed and satisfied, Then, Io does not call it truth, but love? Well, well! my father was an Englishman: My mothers blood in me is not so strong That I should bear this stress of Tuscan noon And keep my wits. The town, there, seems to seethe In this Medæan boil-pot of the sun, And all the patient hills are bubbling round As if a prick would leave them flat. Does heaven Keep far off, not to set us in a blaze? Not so, let drag your fiery fringes, heaven, And burn us up to quiet! Ah, we know Too much here, not to know whats best for peace; We have too much light here, not to want more fire To purify and end us. We talk, talk, Conclude upon divine philosophies, And get the thanks of men for hopeful books; Whereat we take our own life up, and,pshaw! Unless we piece it with anothers life, A yard of silk to carry out our lawn As well suppose my little handkerchief Would cover Samminiato, church and all, If out I threw it past the cypresses, As, in this ragged, narrow life of mine, Contain my own conclusions. But at least Well shut up the persiani, and sit down, And when my heads done aching, in the cool, Write just a word to Kate and Carrington. May joy be with them! she has chosen well, And he not ill. I should be glad, I think, Except for Romney. Had he married Kate, I surely, surely, should be very glad. This Florence sits upon me easily, With native air and tongue. My graves are calm, And do not too much hurt me. Marians good, Gentle and loving, lets me hold the child, Or drags him up the hills to find me flowers And fill those vases, ere I'm quite awake, The grandiose red tulips, which grow wild, Or else my purple lilies, Dante blew To a larger bubble with his prophet-breath; Or one of those tall flowering reeds which stand In Arno like a sheaf of sceptres, left By some remote dynasty of dead gods, To suck the stream for ages and get green, And blossom wheresoeer a hand divine Had warmed the place with ichor. Such Ive found At early morning, laid across my bed, And woke up pelted with a childish laugh Which even Marians low precipitous hush Had vainly interposed to put away, While I, with shut eyes, smile and motion for The dewy kiss thats very sure to come From mouth and cheeks, the whole childs face at once Dissolved on mine, as if a nosegay burst Its string with the weight of roses overblown, And dropt upon me. Surely I should be glad. The little creature almost loves me now, And calls my name,Alola, stripping off The rs like thorns, to make it smooth enough To take between his dainty, milk-fed lips, God love him! I should certainly be glad, Except, God help me, that I'm sorrowful, Because of Romney. Romney, Romney! Well, This grows absurd!—too like a tune that runs I the head, and forces all things in the world, Wind, rain, the creaking gnat or stuttering fly, To sing itself and vex you;—yet perhaps A paltry tune you never fairly liked, Some Id be a butterfly, or Cest lamour: Were made so, not such tyrants to ourselves, We are not slaves to nature. Some of us Are turned, too, overmuch like some poor verse With a trick of ritournelle: the same thing goes And comes back ever. Vincent Carrington Is sorry, and I'm sorry; but hes strong To mount from sorrow to his heaven of love, And when he says at moments, Poor, poor Leigh, Wholl never call his own, so true a heart, So fair a face even, he must quickly lose The pain of pity in the blush he has made By his very pitying eyes. The snow, for him, Has fallen in May, and finds the whole earth warm, And melts at the first touch of the green grass. But Romney, he has chosen, after all. I think he had as excellent a sun To see by, as most others, and perhaps Has scarce seen really worse than some of us, When alls said. Let him pass. I'm not too much A woman, not to be a man for once, And bury all my Dead like Alaric, Depositing the treasures of my soul In this drained water-course, and, letting flow The river of life again, with commerce-ships And pleasure-barges, full of silks and songs. Blow, winds, and help us. Ah, we mock ourselves With talking of the winds! perhaps as much With other resolutions. How it weighs, This hot, sick air! and how I covet here The Deads provision on the rivers couch, With silver curtains drawn on tinkling rings! Or else their rest in quiet crypts, laid by From heat and noise!—from those cicale, say, And this more vexing heart-beat. So it is: We covet for the soul, the bodys part, To die and rot. Even so, Aurora, ends Our aspiration, who bespoke our place So far in the east. The occidental flats Had fed us fatter, therefore? we have climbed Where herbage ends? we want the beasts part now, And tire of the angels?—Men define a man, The creature who stands front-ward to the stars, The creature who looks inward to himself, The tool-wright, laughing creature. Tis enough: Well say instead, the inconsequent creature, man, For thats his specialty. What creature else Conceives the circle, and then walks the square? Loves things proved bad, and leaves a thing proved good? You think the bee makes honey half a year, To loathe the comb in winter, and desire The little ants food rather? But a man— Note men!—they are but women after all, As women are but Auroras!—there are men Born tender, apt to pale at a trodden worm, Who paint for pastime, in their favourite dream, Spruce auto-vestments flowered with crocus-flames: There are, too, who believe in hell, and lie: There are, who waste their souls in working out Lifes problem on these sands betwixt two tides, And end, Now give us the beasts part, in death. Alas, long-suffering and most patient God, Thou needst be surelier God to bear with us Than even to have made us! thou, aspire, aspire From henceforth for me! thou who hast, thyself, Endured this fleshhood, knowing how, as a soaked And sucking vesture, it would drag us down And choke us in the melancholy Deep, Sustain me, that, with thee, I walk these waves, Resisting!—breathe me upward, thou for me Aspiring, who art the way, the truth, the life, That no truth henceforth seem indifferent, No way to truth laborious, and no life, Not even this life I live, intolerable! The days went by. I took up the old days With all their Tuscan pleasures, worn and spoiled, Like some lost book we dropt in the long grass On such a happy summer-afternoon When last we read it with a loving friend, And find in autumn, when the friend is gone, The grass cut short, the weather changed, too late, And stare at, as at something wonderful For sorrow, thinking how two hands, before, Had held up what is left to only one, And how we smiled when such a vehement nail Impressed the tiny dint here, which presents This verse in fire for ever! Tenderly And mournfully I lived. I knew the birds And insects, which look fathered by the flowers And emulous of their hues: I recognised The moths, with that great overpoise of wings Which makes a mystery of them how at all They can stop flying: butterflies, that bear Upon their blue wings such red embers round, They seem to scorch the blue air into holes Each flight they take: and fire-flies, that suspire In short soft lapses of transported flame Across the tingling Dark, while overhead The constant and inviolable stars Outburn those lights-of-love: melodious owls, If music had but one note and was sad, Twould sound just so and all the silent swirl Of bats, that seem to follow in the air Some grand circumference of a shadowy dome To which we are blind: and then, the nightingales, Which pluck our heart across a garden-wall, When walking in the town and carry it So high into the bowery almond-trees, We tremble and are afraid, and feel as if The golden flood of moonlight unaware Dissolved the pillars of the steady earth And made it less substantial. And I knew The harmless opal snakes, and large-mouthed frogs, Those noisy vaunters of their shallow streams And lizards, the green lightnings of the wall, Which, if you sit down still, nor sigh too loud, Will flatter you and take you for a stone, And flash familiarly about your feet With such prodigious eyes in such small heads!— I knew them, though they had somewhat dwindled from My childish imagery, and kept in mind How last I sate among them equally, In fellowship and mateship, as a child Will bear him still toward insect, beast, and bird, Before the Adam in him has foregone All privilege of Eden, making friends And talk, with such a bird or such a goat, And buying many a two-inch-wide rush-cage To let out the caged cricket on a tree, Saying, Oh, my dear grillino, were you cramped? And are you happy with the ilex-leaves? And do you love me who have let you go? Say yes in singing, and Ill understand. But now the creatures all seemed farther off, No longer mine, nor like me; only there, A gulph between us. I could yearn indeed, Like other rich men, for a drop of dew To cool this heat, a drop of the early dew, The irrecoverable child-innocence Before the heart took fire and withered life When childhood might pair equally with birds; But now,the birds were grown too proud for us! Alas, the very sun forbids the dew. And I, I had come back to an empty nest, Which every birds too wise for. How I heard My fathers step on that deserted ground, His voice along that silence, as he told The names of bird and insect, tree and flower, And all the presentations of the stars Across Valdarno, interposing still My child, my child. When fathers say my child, Tis easier to conceive the universe, And lifes transitions down the steps of law. I rode once to the little mountain-house As fast as if to find my father there, But, when in sight oft, within fifty yards, I dropped my horses bridle on his neck And paused upon his flank. The houses front Was cased with lingots of ripe Indian corn In tesselated order, and device Of golden patterns: not a stone of wall Uncovered, not an inch of room to grow A vine-leaf. The old porch had disappeared; And, in the open doorway, sate a girl At plaiting straws, her black hair strained away To a scarlet kerchief caught beneath her chin In Tuscan fashion, her full ebon eyes, Which looked too heavy to be lifted so, Still dropt and lifted toward the mulberry-tree On which the lads were busy with their staves In shout and laughter, stripping all the boughs As bare as winter, of those summer leaves My father had not changed for all the silk In which the ugly silkworms hide themselves. Enough. My horse recoiled before my heart— I turned the rein abruptly. Back we went As fast, to Florence. That was trial enough Of graves. I would not visit, if I could, My fathers, or my mothers any more, To see if stone-cutter or lichen beat So early in the race, or throw my flowers, Which could not out-smell heaven, or sweeten earth. They live too far above, that I should look So far below to find them: let me think That rather they are visiting my grave, This life here, undeveloped yet to life And that they drop upon me, now and then, For token or for solace, some small weed Least odorous of the growths of paradise, To spare such pungent scents as kill with joy. My old Assunta, too, was dead, was dead— O land of all mens past! for me alone, It would not mix its tenses. I was past, It seemed, like others, only not in heaven. And, many a Tuscan eve, I wandered down The cypress alley, like a restless ghost That tries its feeble ineffectual breath Upon its own charred funeral-brands put out Too soon, where, black and stiff, stood up the trees Against the broad vermilion of the skies. Such skies!—all clouds abolished in a sweep Of Gods skirt, with a dazzle to ghosts and men, As down I went, saluting on the bridge The hem of such, before twas caught away Beyond the peaks of Lucca. Underneath, The river, just escaping from the weight Of that intolerable glory, ran In acquiescent shadow murmurously: And up, beside it, streamed the festa-folk With fellow-murmurs from their feet and fans, With issimo and ino and sweet poise Of vowels in their pleasant scandalous talk Returning from the grand-dukes dairy-farm Before the trees grew dangerous at eight, For, trust no tree by moonlight, Tuscans say To eat their ice at Donis tenderly, Each lovely lady close to a cavalier Who holds her dear fan while she feeds her smile On meditative spoonfuls of vanille, He breathing hot protesting vows of love, Enough to thaw her cream, and scorch his beard. Twas little matter. I could pass them by Indifferently, not fearing to be known. No danger of being wrecked upon a friend, And forced to take an iceberg for an isle! The very English, here, must wait to learn To hang the cobweb of their gossip out And catch a fly. I'm happy. Its sublime, This perfect solitude of foreign lands! To be, as if you had not been till then, And were then, simply that you chose to be: To spring up, not be brought forth from the ground, Like grasshoppers at Athens, and skip thrice Before a woman makes a pounce on you And plants you in her hair!—possess, yourself, A new world all alive with creatures new, New sun, new moon, new flowers, new people—ah, And be possessed by none of them! no right In one, to call your name, enquire your where, Or what you think of Mister Some-ones book, Or Mister Others marriage, or decease, Or hows the headache which you had last week, Or why you look so pale still, since its gone? —Such most surprising riddance of ones life Comes next ones death; its disembodiment Without the pang. I marvel, people choose To stand stock-still like fakirs, till the moss Grows on them, and they cry out, self-admired, How verdant and how virtuous! Well, I'm glad: Or should be, if grown foreign to myself As surely as to others. Musing so, I walked the narrow unrecognising streets, Where many a palace-front peers gloomily Through stony vizors iron-barred, prepared Alike, should foe or lover pass that way, For guest or victim and came wandering out Upon the churches with mild open doors And plaintive wail of vespers, where a few, Those chiefly women, sprinkled round in blots Upon the dusky pavement, knelt and prayed Toward the altars silver glory. Oft a ray I liked to sit and watch would tremble out, Just touch some face more lifted, more in need, Of course a womans—while I dreamed a tale To fit its fortunes. There was one who looked As if the earth had suddenly grown too large For such a little humpbacked thing as she; The pitiful black kerchief round her neck Sole proof she had had a mother. One, again, Looked sick for love, seemed praying some soft saint To put more virtue in the new fine scarf She spent a fortnights meals on, yesterday, That cruel Gigi might return his eyes From Giuliana. There was one, so old, So old, to kneel grew easier than to stand, So solitary, she accepts at last Our Lady for her gossip, and frets on Against the sinful world which goes its rounds In marrying and being married, just the same As when twas almost good and had the right, Her Gian alive, and she herself eighteen. And yet, now even, if Madonna willed, Shed win a tern in Thursdays lottery, And better all things. Did she dream for nought, That, boiling cabbage for the fast-days soup, It smelt like blessed entrails? such a dream For nought? would sweetest Mary cheat her so, And lose that certain candle, straight and white As any fair grand-duchess in her teens, Winch otherwise should flare here in a week? Benigna sis, thou beauteous Queen of heaven! I sate there musing, and imagining Such utterance from such faces: poor blind souls That writhed toward heaven along the devils trail, Who knows, I thought, but He may stretch his hand And pick them up? tis written in the Book, He heareth the young ravens when they cry; And yet they cry for carrion.—O my God, And we, who make excuses for the rest, We do it in our measure. Then I knelt, And dropped my head upon the pavement too, And prayed, since I was foolish in desire Like other creatures, craving offal-food, That He would stop his ears to what I said, And only listen to the run and beat Of this poor, passionate, helpless blood— And then I lay, and spoke not. But He heard in heaven. So many Tuscan evenings passed the same! I could not lose a sunset on the bridge, And would not miss a vigil in the church, And liked to mingle with the out-door crowd So strange and gay and ignorant of my face, For men you know not, are as good as trees. And only once, at the Santissima, I almost chanced upon a man I knew, Sir Blaise Delorme. He saw me certainly, And somewhat hurried, as he crossed himself, The smoothness of the action, then half bowed, But only half, and merely to my shade, I slipped so quick behind the porphyry plinth, And left him dubious if twas really I, Or peradventure Satans usual trick To keep a mounting saint uncanonised. But I was safe for that time, and he too; The argent angels in the altar-flare Absorbed his soul, next moment. The good man! In England we were scarce acquaintances, That here in Florence he should keep my thought Beyond the image on his eye, which came And went: and yet his thought disturbed my life: For, after that, I oftener sate at home On evenings, watching how they fined themselves With gradual conscience to a perfect night, Until the moon, diminished to a curve, Lay out there, like a sickle for His hand Who cometh down at last to reap the earth. At such times, ended seemed my trade of verse; I feared to jingle bells upon my robe Before the four-faced silent cherubim: With God so near me, could I sing of God? I did not write, nor read, nor even think, But sate absorbed amid the quickening glooms, Most like some passive broken lump of salt Dropt in by chance to a bowl of œnomel, To spoil the drink a little, and lose itself, Dissolving slowly, slowly, until lost. EIGHTH BOOK. One eve it happened, when I sate alone, Alone, upon the terrace of my tower, A book upon my knees, to counterfeit The reading that I never read at all, While Marian, in the garden down below, Knelt by the fountain I could just hear thrill The drowsy silence of the exhausted day And peeled a new fig from that purple heap In the grass beside her, turning out the red To feed her eager child, who sucked at it With vehement lips across a gap of air As he stood opposite, face and curls a-flame With that last sun-ray, crying, give me, give, And stamping with imperious baby-feet, Were all born princes—something startled me, The laugh of sad and innocent souls, that breaks Abruptly, as if frightened at itself; Twas Marian laughed. I saw her glance above In sudden shame that I should hear her laugh, And straightway dropped my eyes upon my book, And knew, the first time, twas Boccaccios tales, The Falcons, of the lover who for love Destroyed the best that loved him. Some of us Do it still, and then we sit and laugh no more. Laugh you, sweet Marian! youve the right to laugh, Since God himself is for you, and a child! For me theres somewhat less, and so, I sigh. The heavens were making room to hold the night, The sevenfold heavens unfolding all their gates To let the stars out slowly prophesied In close-approaching advent, not discerned, While still the cue-owls from the cypresses Of the Poggio called and counted every pulse Of the skyey palpitation. Gradually The purple and transparent shadows slow Had filled up the whole valley to the brim, And flooded all the city, which you saw As some drowned city in some enchanted sea, Cut off from nature, drawing you who gaze, With passionate desire, to leap and plunge, And find a sea-king with a voice of waves, And treacherous soft eyes, and slippery locks You cannot kiss but you shall bring away Their salt upon your lips. The duomo-bell Strikes ten, as if it struck ten fathoms down, So deep; and fifty churches answer it The same, with fifty various instances. Some gaslights tremble along squares and streets; The Pittis palace-front is drawn in fire; And, past the quays, Maria Novellas Place, In which the mystic obelisks stand up Triangular, pyramidal, each based On a single trine of brazen tortoises, To guard that fair church, Buonarrotis Bride, That stares out from her large blind dial-eyes, Her quadrant and armillary dials, black With rhythms of many suns and moons, in vain Enquiry for so rich a soul as his, Methinks I have plunged, I see it all so clear  And, oh my heart,the sea-king! In my ears The sound of waters. There he stood, my king! I felt him, rather than beheld him. Up I rose, as if he were my king indeed, And then sate down, in trouble at myself, And struggling for my womans empery. Tis pitiful; but women are so made: Well die for you, perhaps, tis probable; But well not spare you an inch of our full height: Well have our whole just stature, five feet four, Though laid out in our coffins: pitiful! —You, Romney!—— Lady Waldemar is here? He answered in a voice which was not his. I have her letter; you shall read it soon: But first, I must be heard a little, I, Who have waited long and travelled far for that, Although you thought to have shut a tedious book And farewell. Ah, you dog-eared such a page, And here you find me. Did he touch my hand, Or but my sleeve? I trembled, hand and foot, He must have touched me.—Will you sit? I asked, And motioned to a chair; but down he sate, A little slowly, as a man in doubt, Upon the couch beside me, couch and chair Being wheeled upon the terrace. You are come, My cousin Romney?—this is wonderful. But all is wonder on such summer-nights; And nothing should surprise us any more, Who see that miracle of stars. Behold. I signed above, where all the stars were out, As if an urgent heat had started there A secret writing from a sombre page, A blank last moment, crowded suddenly With hurrying splendours. Then you do not know— He murmured. Yes, I know, I said, I know. I had the news from Vincent Carrington. And yet I did not think youd leave the work In England, for so much even, though, of course, Youll make a work-day of your holiday, And turn it to our Tuscan peoples use, Who much need helping since the Austrian boar So bold to cross the Alp by Lombardy And dash his brute front unabashed against The steep snow-bosses of that shield of God Who soon shall rise in wrath and shake it clear, Came hither also, raking up our vines And olive-gardens with his tyrannous tusks, And rolling on our maize with all his swine, You had the news from Vincent Carrington, He echoed, picking up the phrase beyond, As if he knew the rest was merely talk To fill a gap and keep out a strong wind, You had, then, Vincents personal news? His own, I answered. All that ruined world of yours Seems crumbling into marriage. Carrington Has chosen wisely. Do you take it so? He cried, and is it possible at last,He paused there, and then, inward to himself, Too much at last, too late!—yet certainly,And there his voice swayed as an Alpine plank That feels a passionate torrent underneath The knowledge, if I had known it, first or last, Had never changed the actual case for me. And best, for her, at this time. Nay, I thought, He loves Kate Ward, it seems, now, like a man, Because he has married Lady Waldemar. Ah, Vincents letter said how Leigh was moved To hear that Vincent was betrothed to Kate. With what cracked pitchers go we to deep wells In this world! Then I spoke, I did not think, My cousin, you had ever known Kate Ward. In fact I never knew her. Tis enough That Vincent did, before he chose his wife For other reasons than those topaz eyes Ive heard of. Not to undervalue them, For all that. One takes up the world with eyes. —Including Romney Leigh, I thought again, Albeit he knows them only by repute. How vile must all men be, since hes a man. His deep pathetic voice, as if he guessed I did not surely love him, took the word; You never got a letter from Lord Howe A month back, dear Aurora? None, I said. I felt it was so, he replied: Yet, strange! Sir Blaise Delorme has passed through Florence? Ay, By chance I saw him in Our Ladys church, I saw him, mark you, but he saw not me Clean-washed in holy water from the count Of things terrestrial, letters and the rest; He had crossed us out together with his sins. Ay, strange; but only strange that good Lord Howe Preferred him to the post because of pauls. For me I'm sworn to never trust a man— At least with letters. There were facts to tell, To smooth with eye and accent. Howe supposed,Well, well, no matter! there was dubious need; You heard the news from Vincent Carrington. And yet perhaps you had been startled less To see me, dear Aurora, if you had read That letter. —Now he sets me down as vexed. I think Ive draped myself in womans pride To a perfect purpose. Oh, I'm vexed, it seems! My friend Lord Howe deputes his friend Sir Blaise, To break as softly as a sparrows egg That lets a bird out tenderly, the news Of Romneys marriage to a certain saint; To smooth with eye and accent, indicate His possible presence. Excellently well Youve played your part, my Lady Waldemar, As Ive played mine. Dear Romney, I began, You did not use, of old, to be so like A Greek king coming from a taken Troy, Twas needful that precursors spread your path With three-piled carpets, to receive your foot And dull the sound oft. For myself, be sure, Although it frankly ground the gravel here, I still could bear it. Yet I'm sorry, too, To lose this famous letter, which Sir Blaise Has twisted to a lighter absently To fire some holy taper with: Lord Howe Writes letters good for all things but to lose; And many a flower of London gossipry Has dropt wherever such a stem broke off, Of course I know that, lonely among my vines, Where nothings talked of, save the blight again, And no more Chianti! Still the letters use As preparation,Did I start indeed? Last night I started at a cockchafer, And shook a half-hour after. Have you learnt No more of women, spite of privilege, Than still to take account too seriously Of such weak flutterings? Why, we like it, sir, We get our powers and our effects that way. The trees stand stiff and still at time of frost, If no wind tears them; but, let summer come, When trees are happy, and a breath avails To set them trembling through a million leaves In luxury of emotion. Something less It takes to move a woman: let her start And shake at pleasure, nor conclude at yours, The winters bitter, but the summers green. He answered, Be the summer ever green With you, Aurora!—though you sweep your sex With somewhat bitter gusts from where you live Above them, whirling downward from your heights Your very own pine-cones, in a grand disdain Of the lowland burrs with which you scatter them. So high and cold to others and yourself, A little less to Romney, were unjust, And thus, I would not have you. Let it pass: I feel content, so. You can bear indeed My sudden step beside you: but for me, Twould move me sore to hear your softened voice, Auroras voice, if softened unaware In pity of what I am. Ah friend, I thought, As husband of the Lady Waldemar Youre granted very sorely pitiable! And yet Aurora Leigh must guard her voice From softening in the pity of your case, As if from lie or licence. Certainly Well soak up all the slush and soil of life With softened voices, ere we come to you. At which I interrupted my own thought And spoke out calmly. Let us ponder, friend, Whateer our state, we must have made it first; And though the thing displease us, ay, perhaps Displease us warrantably, never doubt That other states, thought possible once, and then Rejected by the instinct of our lives, If then adopted, had displeased us more Than this, in which the choice, the will, the love, Has stamped the honour of a patent act From henceforth. What we choose, may not be good; But, that we choose it, proves it good for us Potentially, fantastically, now Or last year, rather than a thing we saw, And saw no need for choosing. Moths will burn Their wings, which proves that light is good for moths, Or else they had flown not, where they agonise, Ay, light is good, he echoed, and there paused. And then abruptly,Marian. Marians well? I bowed my head, but found no word. Twas hard To speak of her to Lady Waldemars New husband. How much did he know, at last? How much? how little?—— He would take no sign, But straight repeated, Marian. Is she well? Shes well, I answered. She was there in sight An hour back, but the night had drawn her home; Where still I heard her in an upper room, Her low voice singing to the child in bed, Who restless with the summer-heat and play And slumber snatched at noon, was long sometimes At falling off, and took a score of songs And mother-hushes, ere she saw him sound. Shes well, I answered. Here? he asked. Yes, here. He stopped and sighed. That shall be presently, But now this must be. I have words to say, And would be alone to say them, I with you, And no third troubling. Speak then, I returned, She will not vex you. At which, suddenly He turned his face upon me with its smile, As if to crush me. I have read your book, Aurora. You have read it, I replied, And I have writ it, we have done with it. And now the rest? The rest is like the first, He answered, for the book is in my heart, Lives in me, wakes in me, and dreams in me: My daily bread tastes of it, and my wine Which has no smack of it, I pour it out; It seems unnatural drinking. Bitterly I took the word up; Never waste your wine. The book lived in me ere it lived in you; I know it closer than another does, And that its foolish, feeble, and afraid, And all unworthy so much compliment. Beseech you, keep your wine, and, when you drink, Still wish some happier fortune to your friend, Than even to have written a far better book. He answered gently, That is consequent: The poet looks beyond the book he has made, Or else he had not made it. If a man Could make a man, hed henceforth be a god In feeling what a little thing is man: It is not my case. And this special book, I did not make it, to make light of it: It stands above my knowledge, draws me up; Tis high to me. It may be that the book Is not so high, but I so low, instead; Still high to me. I mean no compliment: I will not say there are not, young or old, Male writers, ay, or female, let it pass, Wholl write us richer and completer books. A man may love a woman perfectly, And yet by no means ignorantly maintain A thousand women have not larger eyes: Enough that she alone has looked at him With eyes that, large or small, have won his soul. And so, this book, Aurora, so, your book. Alas, I answered, is it so, indeed? And then was silent. Is it so, indeed, He echoed, that alas is all your word? I said, I'm thinking of a far-off June, When you and I, upon my birthday once, Discoursed of life and art, with both untried. I'm thinking, Romney, how twas morning then, And now tis night. And now, he said, tis night. I'm thinking, I resumed, tis somewhat sad That if I had known, that morning in the dew, My cousin Romney would have said such words On such a night, at close of many years, In speaking of a future book of mine, It would have pleased me better as a hope, Than as an actual grace it can at all. Thats sad, I'm thinking. Ay, he said, tis night. And there, I added lightly, are the stars! And here, well talk of stars, and not of books. You have the stars, he murmured, it is well: Be like them! shine, Aurora, on my dark, Though high and cold and only like a star, And for this short night only, you, who keep The same Aurora of the bright June day That withered up the flowers before my face, And turned me from the garden evermore Because I was not worthy. Oh, deserved, Deserved! That I, who verily had not learnt Gods lesson half, attaining as a dunce To obliterate good words with fractious thumbs And cheat myself of the context, I should push Aside, with male ferocious impudence, The worlds Aurora who had conned her part On the other side the leaf! ignore her so, Because she was a woman and a queen, And had no beard to bristle through her song, My teacher, who has taught me with a book, My Miriam, whose sweet mouth, when nearly drowned I still heard singing on the shore! Deserved, That here I should look up unto the stars And miss the glory,Can I understand? I broke in. You speak wildly, Romney Leigh, Or I hear wildly. In that morning-time We recollect, the roses were too red, The trees too green, reproach too natural If one should see not what the other saw: And now, its night, remember; we have shades In place of colours; we are now grown cold, And old, my cousin Romney. Pardon me, I'm very happy that you like my book, And very sorry that I quoted back A ten years birthday; twas so mad a thing In any woman, I scarce marvel much You took it for a venturous piece of spite, Provoking such excuses, as indeed I cannot call you slack in. Understand, He answered sadly, something, if but so. This night is softer than an English day, And men may well come hither when theyre sick, To draw in easier breath from larger air. Tis thus with me; Ive come to you, to you, My Italy of women, just to breathe My soul out once before you, ere I go, As humble as God makes me at the last, I thank Him quite out of the way of men, And yours, Aurora, like a punished child, His cheeks all blurred with tears and naughtiness, To silence in a corner. I am come To speak, beloved  Wisely, cousin Leigh, And worthily of us both! Yes, worthily; For this time I must speak out and confess That I, so truculent in assumption once, So absolute in dogma, proud in aim, And fierce in expectation, I, who felt The whole world tugging at my skirts for help, As if no other man than I, could pull, Nor woman, but I led her by the hand, Nor cloth hold, but I had it in my coat, Do know myself to-night for what I was On that June-day, Aurora. Poor bright day, Which meant the best,a woman and a rose,And which I smote upon the cheek with words, Until it turned and rent me! Young you were, That birthday, poet, but you talked the right: While I,I built up follies like a wall To intercept the sunshine and your face. Your face! thats worse. Speak wisely, cousin Leigh. Yes, wisely, dear Aurora, though too late: But then, not wisely. I was heavy then, And stupid, and distracted with the cries Of tortured prisoners in the polished brass Of that Phalarian bull, society, Which seems to bellow bravely like ten bulls, But, if you listen, moans and cries instead Despairingly, like victims tossed and gored And trampled by their hoofs. I heard the cries Too close: I could not hear the angels lift A fold of rustling air, nor what they said To help my pity. I beheld the world As one great famishing carnivorous mouth, A huge, deserted, callow, black, bird Thing, With piteous open beak that hurt my heart, Till down upon the filthy ground I dropped, And tore the violets up to get the worms. Worms, worms, was all my cry: an open mouth, A gross want, bread to fill it to the lips, No more! That poor men narrowed their demands To such an end, was virtue, I supposed, Adjudicating that to see it so Was reason. Oh, I did not push the case Up higher, and ponder how it answers, when The rich take up the same cry for themselves, Professing equally, an open mouth A gross want, food to fill us, and no more! Why thats so far from virtue, only vice Finds reason for it! That makes libertines: That slurs our cruel streets from end to end With eighty thousand women in one smile, Who only smile at night beneath the gas: The bodys satisfaction and no more, Being used for argument against the souls, Here too! the want, here too, implying the right. —How dark I stood that morning in the sun, My best Aurora, though I saw your eyes, When first you told me,oh, I recollect The words,and how you lifted your white hand, And how your white dress and your burnished curls Went greatening round you in the still blue air, As if an inspiration from within Had blown them all out when you spoke the same, Even these, You will not compass your poor ends Of barley-feeding and material ease, Without the poets individualism To work your universal. It takes a soul, To move a body, it takes a high-souled man, To move the masses,even to a cleaner stye: It takes the ideal, to blow an inch inside The dust of the actual: and your Fouriers failed, Because not poets enough to understand That life develops from within. I say Your words, I could say other words of yours; For none of all your words has been more lost Than sweet verbena, which, being brushed against, Will hold you three hours after by the smell, In spite of long walks on the windy hills. But these words dealt in sharper perfume, these Were ever on me, stinging through my dreams, And saying themselves for ever oer my acts Like some unhappy verdict. That I failed, Is certain. Stye or no stye, to contrive The swines propulsion toward the precipice, Proved easy and plain. I subtly organised And ordered, built the cards up high and higher, Till, some one breathing, all fell flat again; In setting right societys wide wrong, Mere lifes so fatal! So I failed indeed Once, twice, and oftener, hearing through the rents Of obstinate purpose, still those words of yours, You will not compass your poor ends, not you! But harder than you said them; every time Still farther from your voice, until they came To overcrow me with triumphant scorn Which vexed me to resistance. Set down this For condemnation, I was guilty here: I stood upon my deed and fought my doubt, As men will, for I doubted, till at last My deed gave way beneath me suddenly, And left me what I am. The curtain dropped, My part quite ended, all the footlights quenched, My own soul hissing at me through the dark, I, ready for confession, I was wrong, Ive sorely failed; Ive slipped the ends of life, I yield; you have conquered. Stay, I answered him; Ive something for your hearing, also. I Have failed too. You! he said, youre very great; The sadness of your greatness fits you well: As if the plume upon a heros casque Should nod a shadow upon his victor face. I took him up austerely, You have read My book, but not my heart; for recollect, Tis writ in Sanscrit, which you bungle at. Ive surely failed, I know; if failure means To look back sadly on work gladly done, To wander on my mountains of Delight, So called, I can remember a friends words As well as you, sir, weary and in want Of even a sheep-path, thinking bitterly  Well, well! no matter. I but say so much, To keep you, Romney Leigh, from saying more, And let you feel I am not so high indeed, That I can bear to have you at my foot, Or safe, that I can help you. That June-day, Too deeply sunk in craterous sunsets now For you or me to dig it up alive; To pluck it out all bleeding with spent flame At the roots, before those moralising stars We have got instead, that poor lost day, you said Some words as truthful as the thing of mine You care to keep in memory: and I hold If I, that day, and, being the girl I was, Had shown a gentler spirit, less arrogance, It had not hurt me. Ah, youll not mistake The point here. I but only think, you see, More justly, thats more humbly, of myself, Than when I tried a crown on and supposed  Nay, laugh, sir, Ill laugh with you!—pray you, laugh. Ive had so many birthdays since that day, Ive learnt to prize mirths opportunities, Which come too seldom. Was it you who said I was not changed? the same Aurora? Ah, We could laugh there, too! Why, Ulysses dog Knew him, and wagged his tail and died: but if I had owned a dog, I too, before my Troy, And, if you brought him here,I warrant you Hed look into my face, bark lustily, And live on stoutly, as the creatures will Whose spirits are not troubled by long loves. A dog would never know me, I'm so changed; Much less a friend,except that youre misled By the colour of the hair, the trick of the voice, Like that Aurora Leighs. Sweet trick of voice! I would be a dog for this, to know it at last, And die upon the falls of it. O love, O best Aurora! are you then so sad, You scarcely had been sadder as my wife? Your wife, sir! I must certainly be changed, If I, Aurora, can have said a thing So light, it catches at the knightly spurs Of a noble gentleman like Romney Leigh, And trips him from his honourable sense Of what befits,You wholly misconceive, He answered. I returned, I'm glad of it; But keep from misconception, too, yourself: I am not humbled to so low a point, Nor so far saddened. If I am sad at all, Ten layers of birthdays on a womans head, Are apt to fossilise her girlish mirth, Though neer so merry: I'm perforce more wise, And that, in truth, means sadder. For the rest, Look here, sir: I was right upon the whole, That birthday morning. Tis impossible To get at men excepting through their souls, However open their carnivorous jaws; And poets get directlier at the soul, Than any of your œconomists:—for which, You must not overlook the poets work When scheming for the worlds necessities. The souls the way. Not even Christ Himself Can save man else than as He holds mans soul; And therefore did He come into our flesh, As some wise hunter creeping on his knees With a torch, into the blackness of some cave, To face and quell the beast there, take the soul, And so possess the whole man, body and soul. I said, so far, right, yes; not farther, though: We both were wrong that June-day, both as wrong As an east wind had been. I who talked of art, And you who grieved for all mens griefs,what then? We surely made too small a part for God In these things. What we are, imports us more Than what we eat; and life, youve granted me, Develops from within. But innermost Of the inmost, most interior of the interne, God claims his own, Divine humanity Renewing nature, or the piercingest verse, Prest in by subtlest poet, still must keep As much upon the outside of a man, As the very bowl, in which he dips his beard. —And then,the rest. I cannot surely speak. Perhaps I doubt more than you doubted then, If I, the poets veritable charge, Have borne upon my forehead. If I have, It might feel somewhat liker to a crown, The foolish green one even.—Ah, I think, And chiefly when the sun shines, that Ive failed. But what then, Romney? Though we fail indeed, You,I,a score of such weak workers,He Fails never. If He cannot work by us, He will work over us. Does He want a man, Much less a woman, think you? Every time The star winks there, so many souls are born, Who all shall work too. Let our own be calm: We should be ashamed to sit beneath those stars, Impatient that were nothing. Could we sit Just so for ever, sweetest friend, he said, My failure would seem better than success. And yet, indeed, your book has dealt with me More gently, cousin, than you ever will! The book brought down entire the bright June-day, And set me wandering in the garden-walks, And let me watch the garland in a place, You blushed so,nay, forgive me; do not stir: I only thank the book for what it taught, And what, permitted. Poet, doubt yourself; But never doubt that youre a poet to me From henceforth. Ah, youve written poems, sweet, Which moved me in secret, as the sap is moved In still March-branches, signless as a stone: But this last book oercame me like soft rain Which falls at midnight, when the tightened bark Breaks out into unhesitating buds, And sudden protestations of the spring. In all your other books, I saw but you: A man may see the moon so, in a pond, And not be nearer therefore to the moon, Nor use the sight,except to drown himself: And so I forced my heart back from the sight; For what had I, I thought, to do with her, Aurora,Romney? But, in this last book, You showed me something separate from yourself, Beyond you; and I bore to take it in, And let it draw me. You have shown me truths, O June-day friend, that help me now at night, When June is over! truths not yours, indeed, But set within my reach by means of you: Presented by your voice and verse the way To take them clearest. Verily I was wrong; And verily, many thinkers of this age, Ay, many Christian teachers, half in heaven, Are wrong in just my sense, who understood Our natural world too insularly, as if No spiritual counterpart completed it Consummating its meaning, rounding all To justice and perfection, line by line, Form by form, nothing single, nor alone, The great below clenched by the great above; Shade here authenticating substance there; The body proving spirit, as the effect The cause: we, meantime, being too grossly apt To hold the natural, as dogs a bone, Though reason and nature beat us in the face; So obstinately, that well break our teeth Or ever we let go. For everywhere Were too materialistic, eating clay, Like men of the west instead of Adams corn And Noahs wine; clay by handfuls, clay by lumps, Until were filled up to the throat with clay, And grow the grimy colour of the ground On which we are feeding. Ay, materialist The ages name is. God himself, with some, Is apprehended as the bare result Of what his hand materially has made, Expressed in such an algebraic sign, Called God;—that is, to put it otherwise, They add up nature to a naught of God And cross the quotient. There are many, even, Whose names are written in the Christian church To no dishonour, diet still on mud, And splash the altars with it. You might think The clay, Christ laid upon their eyelids when, Still blind, he called them to the use of sight, Remained there to retard its exercise With clogging incrustations. Close to heaven, They see, for mysteries, through the open doors, Vague puffs of smoke from pots of earthenware; And fain would enter, when their time shall come, With quite a different body than St. Paul Has promised, husk and chaff, the whole barley-corn, Or wheres the resurrection? Thus it is, I sighed. And he resumed with mournful face. Beginning so, and filling up with clay The wards of this great key, the natural world, And fumbling vainly therefore at the lock Of the spiritual, we feel ourselves shut in With all the wild-beast roar of struggling life, The terrors and compunctions of our souls, As saints with lions, we who are not saints, And have no heavenly lordship in our stare To awe them backward! Ay, we are forced, so pent, To judge the whole too partially,confound Conclusions. Is there any common phrase Significant, when the adverbs heard alone, The verb being absent, and the pronoun out? But we, distracted in the roar of life, Still insolently at Gods adverb snatch, And bruit against Him that his thought is void, His meaning hopeless;—cry, that everywhere The government is slipping from his hand, Unless some other Christ,say Romney Leigh,Come up, and toil and moil, and change the world, For which the First has proved inadequate, However we talk bigly of His work And piously of His person. We blaspheme At last, to finish that doxology, Despairing on the earth for which He died. So now, I asked, you have more hope of men? I hope, he answered: I am come to think That God will have his work done, as you said, And that we need not be disturbed too much For Romney Leigh or others having failed With this or that quack nostrum, recipes For keeping summits by annulling depths, For learning wrestling with long lounging sleeves, And perfect heroism without a scratch. We fail, what, then? Aurora, if I smiled To see you, in your lovely morning-pride, Try on the poets wreath which suits the noon, Sweet cousin, walls must get the weather-stain Before they grow the ivy! certainly I stood myself there worthier of contempt, Self-rated, in disastrous arrogance, As competent to sorrow for mankind And even their odds. A man may well despair, Who counts himself so needful to success. I failed. I throw the remedy back on God, And sit down here beside you, in good hope. And yet, take heed, I answered, lest we lean Too dangerously on the other side, And so fail twice. Be sure, no earnest work Of any honest creature, howbeit weak, Imperfect, ill-adapted, fails so much, It is not gathered as a grain of sand To enlarge the sum of human action used For carrying out Gods end. No creature works So ill, observe, that therefore hes cashiered. The honest earnest man must stand and work; The woman also; otherwise she drops At once below the dignity of man, Accepting serfdom. Free men freely work: Whoever fears God, fears to sit at ease. He cried, True. After Adam, work was curse; The natural creature labours, sweats and frets. But, after Christ, work turns to privilege; And henceforth one with our humanity, The Six-day Worker, working still in us, Has called us freely to work on with Him In high companionship. So, happiest! I count that Heaven itself is only work To a surer issue. Let us work, indeed, But, no more, work as Adam,nor as Leigh Erewhile, as if the only man on earth, Responsible for all the thistles blown And tigers couchant, struggling in amaze Against disease and winter, snarling on For ever, that the worlds not paradise. Oh cousin, let us be content, in work, To do the thing we can, and not presume To fret because its little. Twill employ Seven men, they say, to make a perfect pin: Who makes the head, content to miss the point, Who makes the point, agreed to leave the join: And if a man should cry, I want a pin, And I must make it straightway, head and point, His wisdom is not worth the pin he wants. Seven men to a pin, and not a man too much! Seven generations, haply, to this world, To right it visibly, a fingers breadth, And mend its rents a little. Oh, to storm And say, This world here is intolerable; I will not eat this corn, nor drink this wine, Nor love this woman, flinging her my soul Without a bond fort, as a lover should, Nor use the generous leave of happiness As not too good for using generously— Since virtue kindles at the touch of joy, Like a mans cheek laid on a womans hand; And God, who knows it, looks for quick returns From joys!—to stand and claim to have a life Beyond the bounds of the individual man, And raze all personal cloisters of the soul To build up public stores and magazines, As if Gods creatures otherwise were lost, The builder surely saved by any means! To think, I have a pattern on my nail, And I will carve the world new after it, And solve so, these hard social questions, nay, Impossible social questions, since their roots Strike deep in Evils own existence here, Which God permits because the questions hard To abolish evil nor attaint free-will. Ay, hard to God, but not to Romney Leigh! For Romney has a pattern on his nail, Whatever may be lacking on the Mount And not being overnice to separate Whats element from whats convention, hastes By line on line, to draw you out a world, Without your help indeed, unless you take His yoke upon you and will learn of him, So much he has to teach! so good a world! The same, the whole creations groaning for! No rich nor poor, no gain nor loss nor stint, No potage in it able to exclude A brothers birthright, and no right of birth, The potage, both secured to every man; And perfect virtue dealt out like the rest, Gratuitously, with the soup at six, To whoso does not seek it. Softly, sir, I interrupted, I had a cousin once I held in reverence. If he strained too wide, It was not to take honour, but give help; The gesture was heroic. If his hand Accomplished nothing,well, it is not proved That empty hand thrown impotently out Were sooner caught, I think, by One in heaven, Than many a hand that reaped a harvest in And keeps the scythes glow on it. Pray you, then, For my sake merely, use less bitterness In speaking of my cousin. Ah, he said, Aurora! when the prophet beats the ass, The angel intercedes. He shook his head— And yet to mean so well, and fail so foul, Expresses neer another beast than man; The antithesis is human. Harken, dear; Theres too much abstract willing, purposing, In this poor world. We talk by aggregates, And think by systems; and, being used to face Our evils in statistics, are inclined To cap them with unreal remedies Drawn out in haste on the other side the slate. Thats true, I answered, fain to throw up thought, And make a game oft; Oh, we generalise Enough to please you. If we pray at all, We pray no longer for our daily bread, But next centenarys harvests. If we give, Our cup of water is not tendered till We lay down pipes and found a Company With Branches. Ass or angel, tis the same: A woman cannot do the thing she ought, Which means whatever perfect thing she can, In life, in art, in science, but she fears To let the perfect action take her part And rest there: she must prove what she can do Before she does it, prate of womans rights, Of womans mission, womans function, till The men who are prating, too, on their side cry, A womans function plainly is,to talk. Poor souls, they are very reasonably vexed! They cannot hear each other speak. And you, An artist, judge so? I, an artist, yes, Because, precisely, I'm an artist, sir, And woman, if another sate in sight, Id whisper, Soft, my sister! not a word! By speaking we prove only we can speak; Which he, the man here, never doubted. What He doubts, is whether we can do the thing With decent grace, weve not yet done at all: Now, do it; bring your statue, you have room! Hell see it even by the starlight here; And if tis eer so little like the god Who looks out from the marble silently Along the track of his own shining dart Through the dusk of ages, theres no need to speak; The universe shall henceforth speak for you, And witness, She who did this thing, was born To do it, claims her license in her work. —And so with more works. Whoso cures the plague, Though twice a woman, shall be called a leech: Who rights a lands finances, is excused For touching coppers, though her hands be white, But we, we talk! It is the ages mood, He said; we boast, and do not. We put up Hostelry signs whereer we lodge a day, Some red colossal cow, with mighty paps A Cyclops fingers could not strain to milk; Then bring out presently our saucer-full Of curds. We want more quiet in our works, More knowledge of the bounds in which we work; More knowledge that each individual man Remains an Adam to the general race, Constrained to see, like Adam, that he keep His personal states condition honestly, Or vain all thoughts of his to help the world, Which still must be developed from its one, If bettered in its many. We, indeed, Who think to lay it out new like a park, We take a work on us which is not mans; For God alone sits far enough above, To speculate so largely. None of us Not Romney Leigh is mad enough to say, Well have a grove of oaks upon that slope And sink the need of acorns. Government, If veritable and lawful, is not given By imposition of the foreign hand, Nor chosen from a pretty pattern-book Of some domestic idealogue, who sits And coldly chooses empire, where as well He might republic. Genuine government Is but the expression of a nation, good Or less good, even as all society, Howeer unequal, monstrous, crazed, and cursed, Is but the expression of mens single lives, The loud sum of the silent units. What, Wed change the aggregate and yet retain Each separate figure? Whom do we cheat by that? Now, not even Romney. Cousin, you are sad. Did all your social labour at Leigh Hall And elsewhere, come to nought then? It was nought, He answered mildly. There is room indeed, For statues still, in this large world of Gods, But not for vacuums, so I am not sad: Not sadder than is good for what I am. My vain phalanstery dissolved itself; My men and women of disordered lives, I brought in orderly to dine and sleep, Broke up those waxen masks I made them wear, With fierce contortions of the natural face; And cursed me for my tyrannous constraint In forcing crooked creatures to live straight; And set the country hounds upon my back To bite and tear me for my wicked deed Of trying to do good without the church Or even the squires, Aurora. Do you mind Your ancient neighbours? The great book-club teems With sketches, summaries, and last tracts but twelve, On socialistic troublers of close bonds Betwixt the generous rich and grateful poor. The vicar preached from Revelations, till The doctor woke and found me with the frogs On three successive Sundays; ay, and stopped To weep a little for hes getting old That such perdition should oertake a man Of such fair acres, in the parish, too! He printed his discourses by request; And if your book shall sell as his did, then Your verses are less good than I suppose. The women of the neighbourhood subscribed, And sent me a copy bound in scarlet silk, Tooled edges, blazoned with the arms of Leigh: I own that touched me. What, the pretty ones? Poor Romney! Otherwise the effect was small. I had my windows broken once or twice By liberal peasants, naturally incensed At such a vexer of Arcadian peace, Who would not let men call their wives their own To kick like Britons, and made obstacles When things went smoothly as a baby drugged, Toward freedom and starvation; bringing down The wicked London tavern-thieves and drabs, To affront the blessed hillside drabs and thieves With mended morals, quotha, fine new lives!— My windows paid fort. I was shot at, once, By an active poacher who had hit a hare From the other barrel, tired of springeing game So long upon my acres, undisturbed, And restless for the countrys virtue, yet He missed me—ay, and pelted very oft In riding through the village. There he goes, Whod drive away our Christian gentlefolks, To catch us undefended in the trap He baits with poisonous cheese, and lock us up In that pernicious prison of Leigh Hall With all his murderers! Give another name, And say Leigh Hell, and burn it up with fire. And so they did, at last, Aurora. Did? You never heard it, cousin? Vincents news Came stinted, then. They did? they burnt Leigh Hall? Youre sorry, dear Aurora? Yes indeed, They did it perfectly: a thorough work, And not a failure, this time. Let us grant Tis somewhat easier, though, to burn a house Than build a system:—yet thats easy, too, In a dream. Books, pictures, ay, the pictures! what, You think your dear Vandykes would give them pause? Our proud ancestral Leighs with those peaked beards, Or bosoms white as foam thrown up on rocks From the old-spent wave. Such calm defiant looks They flared up with! now, nevermore theyll twit The bones in the family-vault with ugly death. Not one was rescued, save the Lady Maud, Who threw you down, that morning you were born, The undeniable lineal mouth and chin, To wear for ever for her gracious sake; For which good deed I saved her: the rest went: And you, youre sorry, cousin. Well, for me, With all my phalansterians safely out, Poor hearts, they helped the burners, it was said, And certainly a few clapped hands and yelled The ruin did not hurt me as it might, As when for instance I was hurt one day, A certain letter being destroyed. In fact, To see the great house flare so,oaken floors, Our fathers made so fine with rushes once, Before our mothers furbished them with trains, Carved wainscoats, panelled walls, the favourite slide For draining off a martyr, or a rogue The echoing galleries, half a half-mile long, And all the various stairs that took you up And took you down, and took you round about Upon their slippery darkness, recollect, All helping to keep up one blazing jest; The flames through all the casements pushing forth, Like red-hot devils crinkled into snakes, All signifying, Look you, Romney Leigh, We save the people from your saving, here, Yet so as by fire! we make a pretty show Besides, and thats the best youve ever done.— —To see this, almost moved myself to clap! The vale et plaude came, too, with effect, When, in the roof fell, and the fire, that paused, Stunned momently beneath the stroke of slates And tumbling rafters, rose at once and roared, And wrapping the whole house, which disappeared In a mounting whirlwind of dilated flame, Blew upward, straight, its drift of fiery chaff In the face of Heaven,which blenched, and ran up higher. Poor Romney! Sometimes when I dream, he said, I hear the silence after; twas so still. For all those wild beasts, yelling, cursing round, Were suddenly silent, while you counted five! So silent, that you heard a young bird fall From the top-nest in the neighbouring rookery Through edging over-rashly toward the light. The old rooks had already fled too far, To hear the screech they fled with, though you saw Some flying on still, like scatterings of dead leaves In autumn-gusts, seen dark against the sky: All flying, ousted, like the House of Leigh. Dear Romney! Evidently twould have been A fine sight for a poet, sweet, like you, To make the verse blaze after. I myself, Even I, felt something in the grand old trees, Which stood that moment like brute Druid gods Amazed upon the rim of ruin, where, As into a blackened socket, the great fire Had dropped, still throwing up splinters now and then, To show them grey with all their centuries, Left there to witness that on such a day The house went out. Ah! While you counted five I seemed to feel a little like a Leigh, But then it passed, Aurora. A child cried; And I had enough to think of what to do With all those houseless wretches in the dark, And ponder where theyd dance the next time, they Who had burnt the viol. Did you think of that? Who burns his viol will not dance, I know, To cymbals, Romney. O my sweet sad voice, He cried, O voice that speaks and overcomes! The sun is silent, but Aurora speaks. Alas, I said; I speak I know not what: I'm back in childhood, thinking as a child, A foolish fancy—will it make you smile? I shall not from the window of my room Catch sight of those old chimneys any more. No more, he answered. If you pushed one day Through all the green hills to our fathers house, Youd come upon a great charred circle where The patient earth was singed an acre round; With one stone-stair, symbolic of my life, Ascending, winding, leading up to nought! Tis worth a poets seeing. Will you go? I made no answer. Had I any right To weep with this man, that I dared to speak? A woman stood between his soul and mine, And waved us off from touching evermore With those unclean white hands of hers. Enough. We had burnt our viols and were silent. So, The silence lengthened till it pressed. I spoke, To breathe: I think you were ill afterward. More ill, he answered, had been scarcely ill. I hoped this feeble fumbling at lifes knot Might end concisely, but I failed to die, As formerly I failed to live, and thus Grew willing, having tried all other ways, To try just Gods. Humilitys so good, When prides impossible. Mark us, how we make Our virtues, cousin, from our worn-out sins, Which smack of them from henceforth. Is it right, For instance, to wed here, while you love there? And yet because a man sins once, the sin Cleaves to him, in necessity to sin; That if he sin not so, to damn himself, He sins so, to damn others with himself: And thus, to wed here, loving there, becomes A duty. Virtue buds a dubious leaf Round mortal brows; your ivys better, dear. —Yet she, tis certain, is my very wife; The very lamb left mangled by the wolves Through my own bad shepherding: and could I choose But take her on my shoulder past this stretch Of rough, uneasy wilderness, poor lamb, Poor child, poor child?—Aurora, my belovd, I will not vex you any more to-night; But, having spoken what I came to say, The rest shall please you. What she can, in me, Protection, tender liking, freedom, ease, She shall have surely, liberally, for her And hers, Aurora. Small amends theyll make For hideous evils which she had not known Except by me and for this imminent loss, This forfeit presence of a gracious friend, Which also she must forfeit for my sake, Since,drop your hand in mine a moment, sweet, Were parting!—— Ah, my snowdrop, what a touch, As if the wind had swept it off! you grudge Your gelid sweetness on my palm but so, A moment? angry, that I could not bear You,speaking, breathing, living, side by side With some one called my wife,and live, myself? Nay, be not cruel—you must understand! Your lightest footfall on a floor of mine Would shake the house, my lintel being uncrossed Gainst angels: henceforth it is night with me, And so, henceforth, I put the shutters up; Auroras must not come to spoil my dark. He smiled so feebly, with an empty hand Stretched sideway from me, as indeed he looked To any one but me to give him help, And, while the moon came suddenly out full, The double-rose of our Italian moons, Sufficient, plainly, for the heaven and earth, The stars, struck dumb and washed away in dews Of golden glory, and the mountains steeped In divine languor he, the man, appeared So pale and patient, like the marble man A sculptor puts his personal sadness in To join his grandeur of ideal thought, As if his mallet struck me from my height Of passionate indignation, I who had risen Pale, doubting, paused,Was Romney mad indeed? Had all this wrong of heart made sick the brain? Then quiet, with a sort of tremulous pride, Go, cousin, I said coldly. A farewell Was sooner spoken twixt a pair of friends In those old days, than seems to suit you now: And if, since then, Ive writ a book or two, I'm somewhat dull still in the manly art Of phrase and metaphrase. Why, any man Can carve a score of white Loves out of snow, As Buonarroti down in Florence there, And set them on the wall in some safe shade, As safe, sir, as your marriage! very good; Though if a woman took one from the ledge To put it on the table by her flowers, And let it mind her of a certain friend, Twould drop at once, so better, would not bear Her nail-mark even, where she took it up A little tenderly; so best, I say: For me, I would not touch so light a thing, And risk to spoil it half an hour before The sun shall shine to melt it: leave it there. I'm plain at speech, direct in purpose: when I speak, youll take the meaning as it is, And not allow for puckerings in the silks By clever stitches. I'm a woman, sir, And use the womans figures naturally, As you, the male license. So, I wish you well. I'm simply sorry for the griefs youve had— And not for your sake only, but mankinds. This race is never grateful: from the first, One fills their cup at supper with pure wine, Which back they give at cross-time on a sponge, In bitter vinegar. If gratefuller, He murmured, by so much less pitiable! Gods self would never have come down to die, Could man have thanked him for it. Happily Tis patent that, whatever, I resumed, You suffered from this thanklessness of men, You sink no more than Moses bulrush-boat, When once relieved of Moses; for youre light, Youre light, my cousin! which is well for you, And manly. For myself, now mark me, sir, They burnt Leigh Hall; but if, consummated To devils, heightened beyond Lucifers, They had burnt instead a star or two, of those We saw above there just a moment back, Before the moon abolished them, destroyed And riddled them in ashes through a sieve On the head of the foundering universe, what then? If you and I remained still you and I, It would not shift our places as mere friends, Nor render decent you should toss a phrase Beyond the point of actual feeling!—nay, You shall not interrupt me: as you said, Were parting. Certainly, not once or twice, To-night youve mocked me somewhat, or yourself; And I, at least, have not deserved it so That I should meet it unsurprised. But now, Enough: were parting,parting. Cousin Leigh, I wish you well through all the acts of life And lifes relations, wedlock, not the least; And it shall please me, in your words, to know You yield your wife, protection, freedom, ease, And very tender liking. May you live So happy with her, Romney, that your friends May praise her for it. Meantime, some of us Are wholly dull in keeping ignorant Of what she has suffered by you, and what debt Of sorrow your rich love sits down to pay: But if tis sweet for love to pay its debt, Tis sweeter still for love to give its gift; And you, be liberal in the sweeter way, You can, I think. At least, as touches me, You owe her, cousin Romney, no amends; She is not used to hold my gown so fast, You need entreat her now to let it go: The lady never was a friend of mine, Nor capable, I thought you knew as much, Of losing for your sake so poor a prize As such a worthless friendship. Be content, Good cousin, therefore, both for her and you! Ill never spoil your dark, nor dull your noon, Nor vex you when youre merry, nor when you rest: You shall not need to put a shutter up To keep out this Aurora. Ah, your north Can make Auroras which vex nobody, Scarce known from evenings! also, let me say, My larks fly higher than some windows. Right; Youve read your Leighs. Indeed twould shake a house, If such as I came in with outstretched hand, Still warm and thrilling from the clasp of one,Of one we know,to acknowledge, palm to palm, As mistress there,the Lady Waldemar. Now God be with us,with a sudden clash Of voice he interrupted—what names that? You spoke a name, Aurora. Pardon me; I would that, Romney, I could name your wife Nor wound you, yet be worthy. Are we mad? He echoed—wife! mine! Lady Waldemar! I think you said my wife. He sprang to his feet, And threw his noble head back toward the moon As one who swims against a stormy sea, And laughed with such a helpless, hopeless scorn, I stood and trembled. May God judge me so, He said at last, I came convicted here, And humbled sorely if not enough. I came, Because this woman from her crystal soul Had shown me something which a man calls light: Because too, formerly, I sinned by her As, then and ever since, I have, by God, Through arrogance of nature, though I loved,Whom best, I need not say,since that is writ Too plainly in the book of my misdeeds; And thus I came here to abase myself, And fasten, kneeling, on her regent brows A garland which I startled thence one day Of her beautiful June-youth. But here again I'm baffled!—fail in my abasement as My aggrandisement: theres no room left for me, At any womans foot, who misconceives My nature, purpose, possible actions. What! Are you the Aurora who made large my dreams To frame your greatness? you conceive so small? You stand so less than woman, through being more, And lose your natural instinct, like a beast, Through intellectual culture? since indeed I do not think that any common she Would dare adopt such fancy-forgeries For the legible life-signature of such As I, with all my blots: with all my blots! At last then, peerless cousin, we are peers— At last were even. Ah, youve left your height; And here upon my level we take hands, And here I reach you to forgive you, sweet, And thats a fall, Aurora. Long ago You seldom understood me, but, before, I could not blame you. Then, you only seemed So high above, you could not see below; But now I breathe, but now I pardon!—nay, Were parting. Dearest, men have burnt my house, Maligned my motives, but not one, I swear, Has wronged my soul as this Aurora has, Who called the Lady Waldemar my wife. Not married to her! yet you said,Again? Nay, read the lines he held a letter out She sent you through me. By the moonlight there, I tore the meaning out with passionate haste Much rather than I read it. Thus it ran. NINTH BOOK. Even thus. I pause to write it out at length, The letter of the Lady Waldemar.— I prayed your cousin Leigh to take you this, He says hell do it. After years of love, Or what is called so, when a woman frets And fools upon one string of a mans name, And fingers it for ever till it breaks, He may perhaps do for her such a thing, And she accept it without detriment Although she should not love him any more. And I, who do not love him, nor love you, Nor you, Aurora, choose you shall repent Your most ungracious letter, and confess, Constrained by his convictions, hes convinced Youve wronged me foully. Are you made so ill, You woman—to impute such ill to me? We both had mothers, lay in their bosom once. Why, after all, I thank you, Aurora Leigh, For proving to myself that there are things I would not do,not for my life,nor him,Though something I have somewhat overdone, For instance, when I went to see the gods One morning on Olympus, with a step That shook the thunder in a certain cloud, Committing myself vilely. Could I think, The Muse I pulled my heart out from my breast To soften, had herself a sort of heart, And loved my mortal? He, at least, loved her; I heard him say so; twas my recompence, When, watching at his bedside fourteen days, He broke out ever like a flame at whiles Between the heats of fever  Is it thou? Breathe closer, sweetest mouth! and when at last The fever gone, the wasted face extinct As if it irked him much to know me there, He said, Twas kind, twas good, twas womanly, And fifty praises to excuse one love But was the picture safe he had ventured for? And then, half wandering,I have loved her well, Although she could not love me.—Say instead, I answered, that she loves you.—Twas my turn To rave: I would have married him so changed, Although the world had jeered me properly For taking up with Cupid at his worst, The silver quiver worn off on his hair. No, no, he murmured, no, she loves me not; Aurora Leigh does better: bring her book And read it softly, Lady Waldemar, Until I thank your friendship more for that, Than even for harder service. So I read Your book, Aurora, for an hour, that day: I kept its pauses, marked its emphasis; My voice, empaled upon rhymes golden hooks, Not once would writhe, nor quiver, nor revolt; I read on calmly, calmly shut it up, Observing, Theres some merit in the book. And yet the merit int is thrown away As chances still with women, if we write Or write not: we want string to tie our flowers, So drop them as we walk, which serves to show The way we went. Good morning, Mister Leigh; Youll find another reader the next time. A woman who does better than to love, I hate; she will do nothing very well: Male poets are preferable, tiring less And teaching more. I triumphed oer you both, And left him. When I saw him afterward, I had read your shameful letter, and my heart. He came with health recovered, strong though pale, Lord Howe and he, a courteous pair of friends, To say what men dare say to women, when Their debtors. But I stopped them with a word; And proved I had never trodden such a road, To carry so much dirt upon my shoe. Then, putting into it something of disdain, I asked forsooth his pardon, and my own, For having done no better than to love, And that, not wisely, though twas long ago, And though twas altered perfectly since then. I told him, as I tell you now, Miss Leigh, And proved I took some trouble for his sake Because I knew he did not love the girl To spoil my hands with working in the stream Of that poor bubbling nature, till she went, Consigned to one I trusted, my own maid, Who once had lived full five months in my house, Dressed hair superbly with a lavish purse To carry to Australia where she had left A husband, said she. If the creature lied, The mission failed, we all do fail and lie More or less—and I'm sorry—which is all Expected from us when we fail the most, And go to church to own it. What I meant, Was just the best for him, and me, and her,Best even for Marian!—I am sorry fort, And very sorry. Yet my creature said She saw her stop to speak in Oxford Street To one,no matter! I had sooner cut My hand off though twere kissed the hour before, And promised a pearl troth-ring for the next Than crush her silly head with so much wrong. Poor child! I would have mended it with gold, Until it gleamed like St. Sophias dome When all the faithful troop to morning prayer: But he, he nipped the bud of such a thought With that cold Leigh look which I fancied once, And broke in, Henceforth she was called his wife. His wife required no succour: he was bound To Florence, to resume this broken bond: Enough so. Both were happy, he and Howe, To acquit me of the heaviest charge of all— —At which I shot my tongue against my fly And struck him; Would he carry, he was just, A letter from me to Aurora Leigh, And ratify from his authentic mouth My answer to her accusation?—Yes, If such a letter were prepared in time. —Hes just, your cousin, ay, abhorrently. Hed wash his hands in blood, to keep them clean. And so, cold, courteous, a mere gentleman, He bowed, we parted. Parted. Face no more, Voice no more, love no more! wiped wholly out Like some ill scholars scrawl from heart and slate, Ay, spit on and so wiped out utterly By some coarse scholar! I have been too coarse, Too human. Have we business, in our rank, With blood i the veins? I will have henceforth none; Not even to keep the colour at my lip. A rose is pink and pretty without blood; Why not a woman? When weve played in vain The game, to adore, we have resources still, And can play on at leisure, being adored: Heres Smith already swearing at my feet That I'm the typic She. Away with Smith!— Smith smacks of Leigh, and, henceforth, Ill admit No socialist within three crinolines, To live and have his being. But for you, Though insolent your letter and absurd, And though I hate you frankly, take my Smith! For when you have seen this famous marriage tied, A most unspotted Erle to a noble Leigh, His love astray on one he should not love Howbeit you should not want his love, beware, Youll want some comfort. So I leave you Smith; Take Smith!—he talks Leighs subjects, somewhat worse; Adopts a thought of Leighs, and dwindles it; Goes leagues beyond, to be no inch behind; Will mind you of him, as a shoe-string may, Of a man: and women, when they are made like you, Grow tender to a shoe-string, footprint even, Adore averted shoulders in a glass, And memories of what, present once, was loathed. And yet, you loathed not Romney, though youve played At fox and goose about him with your soul: Pass over fox, you rub out fox, ignore A feeling, you eradicate it, the acts Identical. I wish you joy, Miss Leigh. Youve made a happy marriage for your friend; And all the honour, well-assorted love, Derives from you who love him, whom he loves! You need not wish me joy to think of it, I have so much. Observe, Aurora Leigh; Your droop of eyelid is the same as his, And, but for you, I might have won his love, And, to you, I have shown my naked heart, For which three things I hate, hate, hate you. Hush, Suppose a fourth!—I cannot choose but think That, with him, I were virtuouser than you Without him: so I hate you from this gulf And hollow of my soul, which opens out To what, except for you, had been my heaven, And is instead, a place to curse by! Love. An active kind of curse. I stood there cursed— Confounded. I had seized and caught the sense Of the letter with its twenty stinging snakes, In a moments sweep of eyesight, and I stood Dazed.—Ah!—not married. You mistake, he said; I'm married. Is not Marian Erle my wife? As God sees things, I have a wife and child; And I, as I'm a man who honours God, Am here to claim them as my child and wife. I felt it hard to breathe, much less to speak. Nor word of mine was needed. Some one else Was there for answering. Romney, she began, My great good angel, Romney. Then at first, I knew that Marian Erle was beautiful. She stood there, still and pallid as a saint, Dilated, like a saint in ecstasy, As if the floating moonshine interposed Betwixt her foot and the earth, and raised her up To float upon it. I had left my child, Who sleeps, she said, and, having drawn this way, I heard you speaking,friend!—Confirm me now. You take this Marian, such as wicked men Have made her, for your honourable wife? The thrilling, solemn, proud, pathetic voice. He stretched his arms out toward the thrilling voice, As if to draw it on to his embrace. —I take her as God made her, and as men Must fail to unmake her, for my honoured wife. She never raised her eyes, nor took a step, But stood there in her place, and spoke again. —You take this Marians child, which is her shame In sight of men and women, for your child, Of whom you will not ever feel ashamed? The thrilling, tender, proud, pathetic voice. He stepped on toward it, still with outstretched arms, As if to quench upon his breast that voice. —May God so father me, as I do him, And so forsake me as I let him feel Hes orphaned haply. Here I take the child To share my cup, to slumber on my knee, To play his loudest gambol at my foot, To hold my finger in the public ways, Till none shall need inquire, Whose child is this, The gesture saying so tenderly, My own. She stood a moment silent in her place; Then, turning toward me, very slow and cold— —And you, what say you?—will you blame me much, If, careful for that outcast child of mine, I catch this hand thats stretched to me and him, Nor dare to leave him friendless in the world Where men have stoned me? Have I not the right To take so mere an aftermath from life, Else found so wholly bare? Or is it wrong To let your cousin, for a generous bent, Put out his ungloved fingers among briars To set a tumbling birds-nest somewhat straight? You will not tell him, though were innocent We are not harmless? and that both our harms Will stick to his good smooth noble life like burrs, Never to drop off though you shake the cloak? Youve been my friend: you will not now be his? Youve known him, that hes worthy of a friend; And youre his cousin, lady, after all, And therefore more than free to take his part, Explaining, since the nest is surely spoilt, And Marian what you know her, though a wife, The world would hardly understand her case Of being just hurt and honest; while for him, Twould ever twit him with his bastard child And married harlot. Speak, while yet theres time: You would not stand and let a good mans dog Turn round and rend him, because his, and reared Of a generous breed, and will you let his act, Because its generous? Speak. I'm bound to you, And Ill be bound by only you, in this. The thrilling, solemn voice, so passionless, Sustained, yet low, without a rise or fall, As one who had authority to speak, And not as Marian. I looked up to feel If God stood near me, and beheld his heaven As blue as Aarons priestly robe appeared To Aaron when he took it off to die. And then I spoke—Accept the gift, I say, My sister Marian, and be satisfied. The hand that gives, has still a soul behind Which will not let it quail for having given, Though foolish worldlings talk they know not what, Of what they know not. Romneys strong enough For this: do you be strong to know hes strong: He stands on Rights side; never flinch for him, As if he stood on the other. Youll be bound By me? I am a woman of repute; No fly-blow gossip ever specked my life; My name is clean and open as this hand, Whose glove theres not a man dares blab about, As if he had touched it freely:—heres my hand To clasp your hand, my Marian, owned as pure! As pure, as I'm a woman and a Leigh!— And, as I'm both, Ill witness to the world That Romney Leigh is honoured in his choice, Who chooses Marian for his honoured wife. Her broad wild woodland eyes shot out a light; Her smile was wonderful for rapture. Thanks, My great Aurora. Forward then she sprang, And dropping her impassioned spaniel head With all its brown abandonment of curls On Romneys feet, we heard the kisses drawn Through sobs upon the foot, upon the ground— O Romney! O my angel! O unchanged, Though, since weve parted, I have past the grave! But Death itself could only better thee, Not change thee!—Thee I do not thank at all: I but thank God who made thee what thou art, So wholly godlike. When he tried in vain To raise her to his embrace, escaping thence As any leaping fawn from a huntsmans grasp, She bounded off and lighted beyond reach, Before him, with a staglike majesty Of soft, serene defiance, as she knew He could not touch her, so was tolerant He had cared to try. She stood there with her great Drowned eyes, and dripping cheeks, and strange sweet smile That lived through all, as if one held a light Across a waste of waters, shook her head To keep some thoughts down deeper in her soul, Then, white and tranquil as a summer-cloud Which, having rained itself to a tardy peace, Stands still in heaven as if it ruled the day, Spoke out again—Although, my generous friend, Since last we met and parted, youre unchanged, And, having promised faith to Marian Erle, Maintain it, as she were not changed at all; And though thats worthy, though thats full of balm To any conscious spirit of a girl Who once has loved you as I loved you once, Yet still it will not make her,if shes dead, And gone away where none can give or take In marriage, able to revive, return And wed you, will it, Romney? Heres the point; O friend, well see it plainer: you and I Must never, never, never join hands so. Nay, let me say it, for I said it first To God, and placed it, rounded to an oath, Far, far above the moon there, at His feet, As surely as I wept just now at yours, We never, never, never join hands so. And now, be patient with me; do not think I'm speaking from a false humility. The truth is, I am grown so proud with grief, And He has said so often through his nights And through his mornings, Weep a little still, Thou foolish Marian, because women must, But do not blush at all except for sin, That I, who felt myself unworthy once Of virtuous Romney and his high-born race, Have come to learn,a woman, poor or rich, Despised or honoured, is a human soul; And what her soul is, that, she is herself, Although she should be spit upon of men, As is the pavement of the churches here, Still good enough to pray in. And, being chaste And honest, and inclined to do the right, And love the truth, and live my life out green And smooth beneath his steps, I should not fear To make him, thus, a less uneasy time Than many a happier woman. Very proud You see me. Pardon, that I set a trap To hear a confirmation in your voice,Both yours and yours. It is so good to know Twas really God who said the same before: For thus it is in heaven, that first God speaks, And then his angels. Oh, it does me good, It wipes me clean and sweet from devils dirt, That Romney Leigh should think me worthy still Of being his true and honourable wife! Henceforth I need not say, on leaving earth, I had no glory in it. For the rest, The reasons ready master, angel, friend, Be patient with me wherefore you and I Can never, never, never join hands so. I know youll not be angry like a man For you are none when I shall tell the truth, Which is, I do not love you, Romney Leigh, I do not love you. Ah well! catch my hands, Miss Leigh, and burn into my eyes with yours, I swear I do not love him. Did I once? Tis said that women have been bruised to death, And yet, if once they loved, that love of theirs Could never be drained out with all their blood: Ive heard such things and pondered. Did I indeed Love once? or did I only worship? Yes, Perhaps, O friend, I set you up so high Above all actual good or hope of good, Or fear of evil, all that could be mine, I haply set you above love itself, And out of reach of these poor womans arms, Angelic Romney. What was in my thought? To be your slave, your help, your toy, your tool. To be your love,I never thought of that. To give you love,still less. I gave you love? I think I did not give you anything; I was but only yours, upon my knees, All yours, in soul and body, in head and heart, A creature you had taken from the ground, Still crumbling through your fingers to your feet To join the dust she came from. Did I love, Or did I worship? judge, Aurora Leigh! But, if indeed I loved, twas long ago, So long! before the sun and moon were made, Before the hells were open, ah, before I heard my child cry in the desert night, And knew he had no father. It may be, I'm not as strong as other women are, Who, torn and crushed, are not undone from love. It may be, I am colder than the dead, Who, being dead, love always. But for me Once killed,this ghost of Marian loves no more, No more,except the child!. no more at all. I told your cousin, sir, that I was dead; And now, she thinks Ill get up from my grave, And wear my chin-cloth for a wedding-veil, And glide along the churchyard like a bride, While all the dead keep whispering through the withes, You would be better in your place with us, You pitiful corruption! At the thought, The damps break out on me like leprosy, Although I'm clean. Ay, clean as Marian Erle: As Marian Leigh, I know, I were not clean: I have not so much life that I should love,Except the child. Ah God! I could not bear To see my darling on a good mans knees, And know by such a look, or such a sigh, Or such a silence, that he thought sometimes, This child was fathered by some cursed wretch,For, Romney, angels are less tender-wise Than God and mothers: even you would think What we think never. He is ours, the child; And we would sooner vex a soul in heaven By coupling with it the dead bodys thought, It left behind it in a last months grave, Than, in my child, see other than,my child. We only, never call him fatherless Who has God and his mother. O my babe, My pretty, pretty blossom, an ill-wind Once blew upon my breast! can any think Id have another, one called happier, A fathered child, with fathers love and race Thats worn as bold and open as a smile, To vex my darling when hes asked his name And has no answer? What! a happier child Than mine, my best, who laughed so loud to-night He could not sleep for pastime? Nay, I swear By life and love, that, if I lived like some, And loved like,some,ay, loved you, Romney Leigh, As some love eyes that have wept so much, see clear, Ive room for no more children in my arms; My kisses are all melted on one mouth; I would not push my darling to a stool To dandle babies. Heres a hand, shall keep For ever clean without a marriage-ring, To tend my boy, until he cease to need One steadying finger of it, and desert Not miss his mothers lap, to sit with men. And when I miss him not he me Ill come And say, Now give me some of Romneys work, To help your outcast orphans of the world, And comfort grief with grief. For you, meantime, Most noble Romney, wed a noble wife, And open on each other your great souls, I need not farther bless you. If I dared But strain and touch her in her upper sphere, And say, Come down to Romney—pay my debt! I should be joyful with the stream of joy Sent through me. But the moon is in my face,I dare not, though I guess the name he loves; I'm learned with my studies of old days, Remembering how he crushed his under-lip When some one came and spoke, or did not come: Aurora, I could touch her with my hand, And fly, because I dare not. She was gone. He smiled so sternly that I spoke in haste. Forgive her—she sees clearly for herself: Her instincts holy, I forgive? he said, I only marvel how she sees so sure, While others,there he paused, then hoarse, abrupt, Aurora! you forgive us, her and me? For her, the thing she sees, poor loyal child, If once corrected by the thing I know, Had been unspoken; since she loves you well, Has leave to love you:—while for me, alas, If once or twice I let my heart escape This night,remember, where hearts slip and fall They break beside: were parting, parting, ah, You do not love, that you should surely know What that word means. Forgive, be tolerant; It had not been, but that I felt myself So safe in impuissance and despair, I could not hurt you though I tossed my arms And sighed my soul out. The most utter wretch Will choose his postures when he comes to die, However in the presence of a queen; And youll forgive me some unseemly spasms Which meant no more than dying. Do you think I had ever come here in my perfect mind, Unless I had come here, in my settled mind, Bound Marians, bound to keep the bond, and give My name, my house, my hand, the things I could, To Marian? For even I could give as much; Even I, affronting her exalted soul By a supposition that she wanted these, Could act the husbands coat and hat set up To creak i the wind and drive the world-crows off From pecking in her garden. Straw can fill A hole to keep out vermin. Now, at last, I own heavens angels round her life suffice To fight the rats of our society, Without this Romney: I can see it at last; And here is ended my pretension which The most pretended. Over-proud of course, Even so!—but not so stupid,blind,that I, Whom thus the great Taskmaster of the world Has set to meditate mistaken work, My dreary face against a dim blank wall Throughout mans natural lifetime, could pretend Or wish,O love, I have loved you! O my soul, I have lost you!—but I swear by all yourself, And all you might have been to me these years, If that June-morning had not failed my hope, I'm not so bestial, to regret that day This night, this night, which still to you is fair; Nay, not so blind, Aurora. I attest Those stars above us, which I cannot see,You cannot  That if Heaven itself should stoop, Remix the lots, and give me another chance, Id say, No other!—Id record my blank. Aurora never should be wife of mine. Not see the stars? Tis worse still, not to see To find your hand, although were parting, dear. A moment let me hold it, ere we part; And understand my last words—these, at last! I would not have you thinking, when I'm gone, That Romney dared to hanker for your love, In thought or vision, if attainable, Which certainly for me it never was And wish to use it for a dog to-day, To help the blind man stumbling. God forbid! And now I know He held you in his palm, And kept you open-eyed to all my faults, To save you at last from such a dreary end. Believe me, dear, that if I had known, like Him, What loss was coming on me, I had done As well in this as He has.—Farewell, you, Who are still my light, farewell! How late it is: I know that, now: youve been too patient, sweet. I will but blow my whistle toward the lane, And some one comes,the same who brought me here. Get in—Good night. A moment. Heavenly Christ! A moment. Speak once, Romney. Tis not true. I hold your hands, I look into your face— You see me? No more than the blessed stars. Be blessed too, Aurora. Ah, my sweet, You tremble. Tender-hearted! Do you mind Of yore, dear, how you used to cheat old John, And let the mice out slily from his traps, Until he marvelled at the soul in mice Which took the cheese and left the snare? The same Dear soft heart always! Twas for this, I grieved Howes letter never reached you. Ah, you had heard Of illness, not the issue,not the extent: My life long sick with tossings up and down; The sudden revulsion in the blazing house, The strain and struggle both of body and soul, Which left fire running in my veins, for blood: Scarce lacked that thunderbolt of the falling beam, Which nicked me on the forehead as I passed The gallery-door with a burden. Say heavens bolt, Not William Eries; not Marians fathers; tramp And poacher, whom I found for what he was, And, eager for her sake to rescue him, Forth swept from the open highway of the world, Road-dust and all, till, like a woodland boar Most naturally unwilling to be tamed, He notched me with his tooth. But not a word To Marian! and I do not think, besides, He turned the tilting of the beam my way, And if he laughed, as many swear, poor wretch, Nor he nor I supposed the hurt so deep. Well hope his next laugh may be merrier, In a better cause. Blind, Romney? Ah, my friend, Youll learn to say it in a cheerful voice. I, too, at first desponded. To be blind, Turned out of nature, mulcted as a man, Refused the daily largesse of the sun To humble creatures! When the fevers heat Dropped from me, as the flame did from my house, And left me ruined like it, stripped of all The hues and shapes of aspectable life, A mere bare blind stone in the blaze of day, A man, upon the outside of the earth, As dark as ten feet under, in the grave, Why that seemed hard. No hope? A tear! you weep, Divine Aurora? tears upon my hand! Ive seen you weeping for a mouse, a bird, But, weep for me, Aurora? Yes, theres hope. Not hope of sight, I could be learned, dear, And tell you in what Greek and Latin name The visual nerve is withered to the root, Though the outer eyes appear indifferent, Unspotted in their chrystals. But theres hope. The spirit, from behind this dethroned sense, Sees, waits in patience till the walls break up From which the bas-relief and fresco have dropt: Theres hope. The man here, once so arrogant And restless, so ambitious, for his part, Of dealing with statistically packed Disorders, from a pattern on his nail, And packing such things quite another way, Is now contented. From his personal loss He has come to hope for others when they lose, And wear a gladder faith in what we gain,Through bitter experience, compensation sweet, Like that tear, sweetest. I am quiet now, As tender surely for the suffering world, But quiet, sitting at the wall to learn, Content, henceforth, to do the thing I can: For, though as powerless, said I, as a stone, A stone can still give shelter to a worm, And it is worth while being a stone for that: Theres hope, Aurora. Is there hope for me? For me?—and is there room beneath the stone For such a worm?—And if I came and said,What all this weeping scarce will let me say, And yet what women cannot say at all, But weeping bitterly,the pride keeps up, Until the heart breaks under it,I love, I love you, Romney  Silence! he exclaimed. A womans pity sometimes makes her mad. A mans distraction must not cheat his soul To take advantage of it. Yet, tis hard— Farewell, Aurora. But I love you, sir; And when a woman says she loves a man, The man must hear her, though he love her not, Which,hush!. he has leave to answer in his turn; She will not surely blame him. As for me, You call it pity, think I'm generous? Twere somewhat easier, for a woman proud As I am, and I'm very vilely proud, To let it pass as such, and press on you Love born of pity, seeing that excellent loves Are born so, often, nor the quicklier die, And this would set me higher by the head Than now I stand. No matter: let the truth Stand high; Aurora must be humble: no, My loves not pity merely. Obviously I'm not a generous woman, never was, Or else, of old, I had not looked so near To weights and measures, grudging you the power To give, as first I scorned your power to judge For me, Aurora: I would have no gifts Forsooth, but Gods, and I would use them, too, According to my pleasure and my choice, As He and I were equals, you, below, Excluded from that level of interchange Admitting benefaction. You were wrong In much? you said so. I was wrong in most. Oh, most! You only thought to rescue men By half-means, half-way, seeing half their wants, While thinking nothing of your personal gain. But I who saw the human nature broad, At both sides, comprehending, too, the souls, And all the high necessities of Art, Betrayed the thing I saw, and wronged my own life For which I pleaded. Passioned to exalt The artists instinct in me at the cost Of putting down the womans, I forgot No perfect artist is developed here From any imperfect woman. Flower from root, And spiritual from natural, grade by grade In all our life. A handful of the earth To make Gods image! the despised poor earth, The healthy odorous earth, I missed, with it, The divine Breath that blows the nostrils out To ineffable inflatus: ay, the breath Which love is. Art is much, but love is more. O Art, my Art, thourt much, but Love is more! Art symbolises heaven, but Love is God And makes heaven. I, Aurora, fell from mine: I would not be a woman like the rest, A simple woman who believes in love, And owns the right of love because she loves, And, hearing shes beloved, is satisfied With what contents God: I must analyse, Confront, and question; just as if a fly Refused to warm itself in any sun Till such was in leone: I must fret Forsooth, because the month was only May; Be faithless of the kind of proffered love, And captious, lest it miss my dignity, And scornful, that my lover sought a wife To use,to use! O Romney, O my love, I am changed since then, changed wholly, for indeed, If now youd stoop so low to take my love, And use it roughly, without stint or spare, As men use common things with more behind, And, in this, ever would be more behind To any mean and ordinary end, The joy would set me like a star, in heaven, So high up, I should shine because of height And not of virtue. Yet in one respect, Just one, beloved, I am in no wise changed: I love you, loved you,loved you first and last, And love you on for ever. Now I know I loved you always, Romney. She who died Knew that, and said so; Lady Waldemar Knows that;,and Marian: I had known the same Except that I was prouder than I knew, And not so honest. Ay, and, as I live, I should have died so, crushing in my hand This rose of love, the wasp inside and all, Ignoring ever to my soul and you Both rose and pain, except for this great loss, This great despair, to stand before your face And know I cannot win a look of yours. You think, perhaps, I am not changed from pride, And that I chiefly bear to say such words, Because you cannot shame me with your eyes? O calm, grand eyes, extinguished in a storm, Blown out like lights oer melancholy seas, Though shrieked for by the shipwrecked, O my Dark, My Cloud, to go before me every day While I go ever toward the wilderness, I would that you could see me bare to the soul!— If this be pity, tis so for myself, And not for Romney: he can stand alone; A man like him is never overcome: No woman like me, counts him pitiable While saints applaud him. He mistook the world: But I mistook my own heart, and that slip Was fatal. Romney, will you leave me here? So wrong, so proud, so weak, so unconsoled, So mere a woman!—and I love you so, I love you, Romney. Could I see his face, I wept so? Did I drop against his breast, Or did his arms constrain me? Were my cheeks Hot, overflooded, with my tears, or his? And which of our two large explosive hearts So shook me? That, I know not. There were words That broke in utterance,melted, in the fire; Embrace, that was convulsion,then a kiss,As long and silent as the ecstatic night, And deep, deep, shuddering breaths, which meant beyond Whatever could be told by word or kiss. But what he said,I have written day by day, With somewhat even writing. Did I think That such a passionate rain would intercept And dash this last page? What he said, indeed, I fain would write it down here like the rest, To keep it in my eyes, as in my ears, The hearts sweet scripture, to be read at night When weary, or at morning when afraid, And lean my heaviest oath on when I swear That, when alls done, all tried; all counted here, All great arts, and all good philosophies, This love just puts its hand out in a dream, And straight outreaches all things. What he said, I fain would write. But if an angel spoke In thunder, should we, haply, know much more Than that it thundered? If a cloud came down And wrapt us wholly, could we draw its shape, As if on the outside, and not overcome? And so he spake. His breath against my face Confused his words, yet made them more intense, As when the sudden finder of the wind Will wipe a row of single city-lamps To a pure white line of flame, more luminous Because of obliteration; more intense, The intimate presence carrying in itself Complete communication, as with souls Who, having put the body off, perceive Through simply being. Thus, twas granted me To know he loved me to the depth and height Of such large natures, ever competent With grand horizons by the land or sea, To loves grand sunrise. Small spheres hold small fires: But he loved largely, as a man can love Who, baffled in his love, dares live his life, Accept the ends which God loves, for his own, And lift a constant aspect. From the day I had brought to England my poor searching face, An orphan even of my fathers grave He had loved me, watched me, watched his soul in mine, Which in me grew and heightened into love. For he, a boy still, had been told the tale Of how a fairy bride from Italy, With smells of oleanders in her hair, Was coming through the vines to touch his hand; Whereat the blood of boyhood on the palm Made sudden heats. And when at last I came, And lived before him, lived, and rarely smiled, He smiled and loved me for the thing I was, As every child will love the years first flower, Not certainly the fairest of the year, But, in which, the complete year seems to blow The poor sad snowdrop, growing between drifts, Mysterious medium twixt the plant and frost, So faint with winter while so quick with spring, So doubtful if to thaw itself away With that snow near it. Not that Romney Leigh Had loved me coldly. If I thought so once, It was as if I had held my hand in fire And shook for cold. But now I understood For ever, that the very fire and heat Of troubling passion in him, burned him clear, And shaped to dubious order, word and act: That, just because he loved me over all, All wealth, all lands, all social privilege, To which chance made him unexpected heir, And, just because on all these lesser gifts, Constrained by conscience and the sense of wrong He had stamped with steady hand Gods arrow-mark Of dedication to the human need, He thought it should be so too, with his love; He, passionately loving, would bring down His love, his life, his best, because the best His bride of dreams, who walked so still and high Through flowery poems as through meadow-grass, The dust of golden lilies on her feet, That she should walk beside him on the rocks In all that clang and hewing out of men, And help the work of help which was his life, And prove he kept back nothing, —not his soul. And when I failed him, —for I failed him, I— And when it seemed he had missed my love, he thought, Aurora makes room for a working-noon; And so, self-girded with torn strips of hope, Took up his life, as if it were for death, Just capable of one heroic aim, And threw it in the thickest of the world, At which men laughed as if he had drowned a dog: No wonder, since Aurora failed him first! The morning and the evening made his day. But oh, the night! oh, bitter-sweet! oh, sweet! O dark, O moon and stars, O ecstasy Of darkness! O great mystery of love, In which absorbed, loss, anguish, treasons self Enlarges rapture, as a pebble dropt In some full wine-cup, over-brims the wine! While we two sate together, leaned that night So close, my very garments crept and thrilled With strange electric life; and both my cheeks Grew red, then pale, with touches from my hair In which his breath was; while the golden moon Was hung before our faces as the badge Of some sublime inherited despair, Since ever to be seen by only one, A voice said, low and rapid as a sigh, Yet breaking, I felt conscious, from a smile, Thank God, who made me blind, to make me see! Shine on, Aurora, dearest light of souls, Which rulst for evermore both day and night! I am happy. I flung closer to his breast, As sword that, after battle, flings to sheathe; And, in that hurtle of united souls, The mystic motions which in common moods Are shut beyond our sense, broke in on us, And, as we sate, we felt the old earth spin, And all the starry turbulence of worlds Swing round us in their audient circles, till If that same golden moon were overhead Or if beneath our feet, we did not know. And then calm, equal, smooth with weights of joy, His voice rose, as some chief musicians song Amid the old Jewish temples Selah-pause, And bade me mark how we two met at last Upon this moon-bathed promontory of earth, To give up much on each side, then take all. Beloved, it sang, we must be here to work; And men who work, can only work for men, And, not to work in vain, must comprehend Humanity, and, so, work humanly, And raise mens bodies still by raising souls, As God did, first. But stand upon the earth, I said, to raise them, this is human too; Theres nothing high which has not first been low; My humbleness, said One, has made me great! As God did, last. And work all silently, And simply, he returned, as God does all; Distort our nature never, for our work, Nor count our right hands stronger for being hoofs. The man most man, with tenderest human hands, Works best for men, as God in Nazareth. He paused upon the word, and then resumed; Fewer programmes; we who have no prescience. Fewer systems; we who are held and do not hold. Less mapping out of masses, to be saved, By nations or by sexes. Fouriers void, And Comte is dwarfed, and Cabet, puerile. Subsists no law of life outside of life; No perfect manners, without Christian souls: The Christ himself had been no Lawgiver, Unless He had given the life, too, with the law. I echoed thoughtfully—The man, most man, Works best for men: and, if most man indeed, He gets his manhood plainest from his soul: While, obviously, this stringent soul itself Obeys our old rules of development; The Spirit ever witnessing in ours, And Love, the soul of soul, within the soul, Evolving it sublimely. First, Gods love. And next, he smiled, the love of wedded souls, Which still presents that mysterys counterpart. Sweet shadow-rose, upon the water of life, Of such a mystic substance, Sharon gave A name to! human, vital, fructuous rose, Whose calyx holds the multitude of leaves, Loves filial, loves fraternal, neighbour-loves, And civic,all fair petals, all good scents, All reddened, sweetened from one central Heart! Alas, I cried, it was not long ago, You swore this very social rose smelt ill. Alas, he answered, is it a rose at all? The filials thankless, the fraternals hard, The rest is lost. I do but stand and think, Across dim waters of a troubled life The Flower of Heaven so vainly overhangs, What perfect counterpart would be in sight, If tanks were clearer. Let us clean the tubes, And wait for rains. O poet, O my love, Since I was too ambitious in my deed, And thought to distance all men in success, Till God came on me, marked the place, and said, Ill-doer, henceforth keep within this line, Attempting less than others, and I stand And work among Christs little ones, content, Come thou, my compensation, my dear sight, My morning-star, my morning! rise and shine, And touch my hills with radiance not their own; Shine out for two, Aurora, and fulfil My falling-short that must be! work for two, As I, though thus restrained, for two, shall love! Gaze on, with inscient vision toward the sun, And, from his visceral heat, pluck out the roots Of light beyond him. Arts a service, mark: A silver key is given to thy clasp, And thou shalt stand unwearied, night and day, And fix it in the hard, slow-turning wards, And open, so, that intermediate door Betwixt the different planes of sensuous form And form insensuous, that inferior men May learn to feel on still through these to those, And bless thy ministration. The world waits For help. Beloved, let us love so well, Our work shall still be better for our love, And still our love be sweeter for our work, And both, commended, for the sake of each, By all true workers and true lovers born. Now press the clarion on thy womans lip Loves holy kiss shall still keep consecrate And breathe the fine keen breath along the brass, And blow all class-walls level as Jerichos Past Jordan; crying from the top of souls, To souls, that they assemble on earths flats To get them to some purer eminence Than any hitherto beheld for clouds! What height we know not, but the way we know, And how by mounting aye, we must attain, And so climb on. It is the hour for souls; That bodies, leavened by the will and love, Be lightened to redemption. The worlds old; But the old world waits the hour to be renewed: Toward which, new hearts in individual growth Must quicken, and increase to multitude In new dynasties of the race of men, Developed whence, shall grow spontaneously New churches, new œconomies, new laws Admitting freedom, new societies Excluding falsehood. He shall make all new. My Romney!—Lifting up my hand in his, As wheeled by Seeing spirits toward the east, He turned instinctively, where, faint and fair, Along the tingling desert of the sky, Beyond the circle of the conscious hills, Were laid in jasper-stone as clear as glass The first foundations of that new, near Day Which should be builded out of heaven, to God. He stood a moment with erected brows, In silence, as a creature might, who gazed: Stood calm, and fed his blind, majestic eyes Upon the thought of perfect noon. And when I saw his soul saw, Jasper first, I said, And second, sapphire; third, chalcedony; The rest in order,last, an amethyst. `
const posthuman = ` It is now clear that humans are no longer the most important things in the universe. This is something the humanists have yet to accept. All technological progress of human society is geared towards the transformation of the human species as we currently know it. In the posthuman era many beliefs become redundant — not least the belief in human beings. Human beings, like gods, only exist inasmuch as we believe them to exist. The future never arrives. All humans are not born equal, but it is too dangerous not to pretend that they are. In the posthuman era, machines will no longer be machines. It is a deficiency of humans that they require others to tell them what they already know. It is only then they will believe it. Posthumanists do not fall into the trap of imagining a society where everything works well. Economic and political theories are as futile as long-range weather predictions.1 Surf or die. You can’t control a wave, but you can ride it.1 We now realise that human knowledge, creativity and intelligence are ultimately limited.1 Complex machines are an emerging form of life.1 A complex machine is a machine whose workings we do not fully understand or control.1 As computers develop to be more like humans, so humans develop to like computers more.1 If we can think of machines then machines can think; if we can think of machines that think, then machines can think of us. II. Statements on consciousness, humans and philosophy If consciousness is a property that emerges from a specific set of conditions, in order to synthesise it we do not need to re-model it from the ‘top-down’. We only need to recreate the conditions from which it might emerge. This requires an understanding of what those conditions are. Consciousness is not exclusively restricted to the brain. Consciousness is the function of an organism, not an organ. One does not understand consciousness by studying the brain alone. The mind and the body act together to produce consciousness. If one is absent consciousness ceases. There is no pure thought isolated from a body. In order to function the brain must be connected to a body, even if the body is artificial. Consciousness is an effect that arises through the co-operation of a brain and body; we think with our whole body. Consciousness can only be considered as an emergent property. In this sense it is like boiling: given sufficient heat, gravity and air pressure the water in a kettle will start to boil. We can see what boiling is, we can recognise it as something to which we give a name, we do not consider it mysterious, yet we cannot isolate it from the conditions which produced it. Likewise, consciousness is a property that emerges from a given set of conditions. To say that conscious thought is not exclusively a function of the brain does not deny that the brain has a significant part to play. Human bodies have no boundaries. No finite division can be drawn between the environment, the body and the brain. The human is identifiable, but not definable. Consciousness (mind) and the environment (reality) cannot be separated; they are continuous.1 There is nothing external to a human, because the extent of a human cannot be fixed.1 If we accept that the mind and body cannot be absolutely separated, and that the body and the environment cannot be absolutely separated, then we are left with the apparently absurd yet logically consistent conclusion that consciousness and the environment cannot be absolutely separated. 1 First we had God, humans and nature. The rationalists dispensed with God, leaving humans in perpetual conflict with nature. The posthumanists dispense with humans leaving only nature. The distinctions between God, nature and humanity does not represent any eternal truth about the human condition. It merely reflects the prejudices of the societies that maintained the distinctions.1 Idealistic and materialistic philosophical views both assume a division between the thing that thinks and the thing that is thought about — between the internal mind (brain) and external reality (environment). Remove this division and both views become redundant.1 The idealists think that the only things that exist are ideas; the materialists think that the only thing that exists is matter. It must be remembered that ideas are not independent of matter and that matter is just an idea.1 Most philosophical problems are debates about language. They arise because of the mistaken assumptions a. that language is consistent and b. that because a word exists there must exist a ‘thing’ that it represents and c. that the things that are represented should, in themselves, be consistent.1 Logic is an illusion of human imagination. Truth and falsity do not exist in nature — other than in human thought. III. Statements on science, nature and the universe Science will never achieve its aim of comprehending the ultimate nature of reality. It is a futile quest, although many scientists do not acknowledge this yet. The universe(s) will always be more complex than we will ever understand. The posthuman abandons the search for the ultimate nature of the universe and its origin (thus saving a lot of money in the process). The posthuman realises that the ultimate questions about existence and being do not require answers. The answer to the question ‘Why are we here?’ is that there is no answer. To know the ultimate nature of the universe would require knowing everything about the universe, everything that has happened and everything that will happen. If one thing were not known it would imply that all knowledge of the universe is partial, potentially incomplete and, therefore, not ultimate No scientific model can ever be complete, but will always be partial and contingent. For any model to be complete it would have to take all influential factors into account, no matter how insignificant. Since this is impossible the scientist must make an arbitrary decision about which ones to ignore. Having ignored some factors their model is incomplete, although this does not mean it isn’t useful. The posthuman accepts that humans have a finite capacity to understand and control nature. All origins are ends and all ends are origins. Chaos theory has often been illustrated with the image of a butterfly’s wing-flap causing a thunderstorm on the opposite side of the globe. Whilst this might illustrate the sensitivity of systems to initial states, it does not take into account what caused the butterfly to flap its wings — a gust of wind? Logic that seems consistent at the human scale cannot necessarily be applied to the microcosmic or the macrocosmic scale. Our knowledge about the universe is constrained by the level of resolution with which we are able to view it. Knowledge is contingent on data — data varies with resolution.1 Scientists give privilege to order over disorder on the assumption that they are gradually discovering the essential laws of nature. This is a fundamental error; nature is neither essentially ordered or disordered. What we perceive as regular, patterned information we classify as order; what we perceive as irregular, unpatterned information we classify as disorder. The appearance of order and disorder implies more about the way in which we process information than the intrinsic presence of order or disorder in nature.1 Science works on the basis of an intrinsic universal order. It assumes that all phenomena are subject to physical laws and that some of those laws are well understood, some partially understood, and some unknown. The posthuman accepts that laws are not things that are intrinsic to nature, nor are they things which arise purely in the mind and are imposed on nature. This would reinforce the division between the mind and reality which we have already abandoned. The order that we commonly perceive around us, as well as the disorder, is not a function exclusively of either the universe or our consciousness, but a combination of both, since they cannot really be separated.1 Everything that exists anywhere is energy. Beside the fact that all material processes are energetically driven, energy has two major properties: a. It manifests in an infinite variety of waysb. It perpetually transforms 1 The appearance of matter is an illusion generated by interactions among energetic systems at the human level of resolution.1 Humans and the environment are different expressions of energy; the only difference between them is the form that energy takes.1 The posthuman is entirely open to ideas of ‘paranormality’, ‘immateriality’, the ‘supernatural’, and the ‘occult’. The posthuman does not accept that faith in scientific methods is superior to faith in other belief systems.  IV. Statements on (dis)order and (dis)continuity Order and disorder are relative, not absolute, qualities. The proof that order and disorder are relative qualities lies in the fact that they define each other. Anything we perceive can be considered to contain different degrees of order and disorder. The perception of order and disorder in something is contingent on the level of resolution from which it is viewed. What we perceive as ordered and disordered is often culturally determined. Logicians will assert that there are mathematical ways of defining disorder, entropy and complexity — ways that are independent of human subjectivity. Whilst these definitions may be useful in certain applications they remain open to relativistic interpretation. In posthuman terms, the apparent distinctions between ‘things’ are not the result of innate divisions within the structure of the universe, but rather are jointly a product of: a. the way in which the sensual processes in living entities operate.b. the variety of ways in which energy is manifested in the universe. The ways in which energy manifestations are perceived by an observer can always be described with two simple qualities — continuity and discontinuity. Continuity is non-interruption of space-time. Discontinuity is a rupture in space-time. Both qualities can be discerned in all events depending upon how they are viewed. More importantly, they are both experienced simultaneously. Energy manifestations should not be thought of as intrinsically continuous or discontinuous; that is, there are no absolute qualities of energy. Energetic states will appear as either continuous or discontinuous to an observer depending upon their viewing position. The quality of (dis)continuity is context sensitive. What distinguishes things from one another is the perceived dis-continuities they display. The difference in manifestations of energy between a philosopher and a chair allows them each to be distinguished. The level of complexity in a system cannot be defined in objective that is, absolute terms. Complexity is a function of human cognition, not an intrinsic property of anything we might look at. V. Statements on thought, meaning and being As long as models about how the brain might work are defective being based on fallacious assumptions, the creation of a synthetic consciousness will be impractical. Human thought is something that occurs in co-operation with the human body. It is not necessary to identify precisely where it occurs because it does not occur precisely in any ‘part’. It is tempting to think of thoughts as blocks of data in the brain. This would be a mistake since it reinforces a static view of mental activity. A thought is a path through the cognitive medium. Think of it like this: taking the London Underground map as an analogy of how the mind works, some people would say, ‘Each of the stations on the map represents one of our thoughts and the lines represent the links between them. The lines are what enable us to get from thought to thought.’ The posthuman argues ‘A thought is not a station on the map but the route from one station to another.’ That is, a thought is actuated in the process of traveling, rather than being a particular destination. Given that a thought is activated, for whatever reason, it consists in a process of traveling through the cognitive medium that supports the mind. A thought does not exist unless it is being thought; otherwise it remains a field of potentiality, or attractor. The most likely journey that a thought may take once it has been activated defines its path. Similar thoughts will take similar paths. Paths can be created in a number of ways, including direct experience, learning, prior cognition, and the act of thinking itself. In neuro-physiological terms the paths include, but are not restricted to, the connections between neurons and the probability of their firing. Moreover, the neural fabric is not a static substance. It is continually changing in response to stimulation and activation and just as prone to adaptation just as the skin or muscles are. The path that a thought takes is not uni-linear in the way that we normally think of paths. A thought may take many different routes simultaneously. The occurrence of one particular thought may require that we bring together many different thoughts in combination. The fact that different thoughts may lie in different paths, each of which are distinct insofar as each thought is distinct, shows us how we can imagine things we have never seen. We are unlikely to have seen a girl with kaleidoscope eyes but we can imagine what she looks like by making a composite image of the components, i.e. traveling through several distinct thought paths at once. The activity of thinking is regulated by the conduct of energy in the cognitive medium. This medium is no different from any other system in that it represents a particular process of energy transformations. Where two thoughts are continuous (for example, ‘blue’ and ‘sky’ in the sentence ‘The sky is blue’), the pathway between each of these thoughts is well established, and it will require little energy to pass from one to the other. Where two thoughts are not well connected (for example, between ‘myrrh and ‘capstan’ in the phrase ‘The myrrh-capstan’) more energy is required to fuse the thoughts since they have less well-established connections. Ideas that can proceed from one to another with relatively little effort (energy) can be considered continuous. Ideas that require great effort to travel between can be considered discontinuous. The presence or absence of ‘meaning’ is determined by the amount of energy required to pass from one concept to another. Difficult meaning arises from the co-existence of concepts that are semantically distant, that is, when there is not a well-established connection between them. However, the path between concepts that have little or no connection may be too difficult to travel. For example in the phrase ‘Echoes the wasp’s virile down-plate’, whilst not meaningless, is certainly awkward to assemble by the standard of most phrases.1 In order to maintain a sense of being the human tries to establish continuity in response to the stimuli it receives from the environment. Such stimuli are both stable and unstable since the environment displays different amounts of each. The development of stable thought paths which correspond to stable stimuli generates a sense of order. Over time such stability develops into a sense of being.1 Were the sense of order not perpetually threatened by the recurrence of random stimuli there would be no compulsion to re-assert order. As it is, since humans are continually faced with random stimuli, it is necessary to keep re-asserting order (maintaining meaning) so that we do not dissolve into chaos, thereby losing our sense of being.1 In posthuman terms, it is unimportant how this process of being occurs. The same effect can be achieved in a number of different ways. It is true that we can learn from the human what is necessary for being, but this does not mean that it is the only way it can be implemented. VI. Statements on uncertainty The humanist era was characterised by certainty about the operation of the universe and the place of humans within it. The posthuman era is characterised by uncertainty about the operation of the universe and about what it is to be human. Questions arise in the posthuman era that would have not troubled us in the humanist era — What is a human? Is there such a thing? Historically, we could say the posthuman era, the age of uncertainty, was born in the period leading up to World War I since this was the time we were introduced to quantum physics and cubism. The consequences of both made one thing clear: in the words of Heisenberg, ‘There are no things, just probabilities.’ Uncertainty is becoming familiar. There is uncertainty about lifetime employment, about political and economic theory, about what is happening to the environment, about whether scientific progress is always beneficial and about where technology is leading us. What can we say is certain? Only that which we have to accept as certain for some other reason. In posthuman terms uncertainty is nothing to fear. The world has always been as uncertain as it is now. What has changed is that it is now much harder to impose authority since increased information flow diminishes authority: there is more information, therefore, there is less false sense of certainty. Certainty, like belief, only arises in the absence of full information. Uncertainty is certain. VII. Statements on art and creativity The production and appreciation of art is a particularly human faculty. It is often cited by humanists as the highest expression of human thought and the thing that most distinguishes us from machines. It would, therefore, be fair to admit that the posthuman era cannot begin in full until we have met this challenge from the humanists. In order to develop a machine that can produce and appreciate art we must first have a clearer understanding of what it is.What is art? One useful definition is that it describes any commodity of the art market. We must distinguish between an art object and an aesthetically stimulating object. An art object is a commodity that is traded on the art market. An aesthetic object is one that is appreciated for its aesthetic quality. Something may be both an art object and an aesthetic object, such as Van Gogh’s ‘Irises’. Something may be an aesthetic object without being art, like a sunset or an iris. Many people think that much modern art is not art because they consider it to lack aesthetic value, even though it commands high prices on the art market. They are simply confusing the art value and the aesthetic value of an object. These two values are quite separate, but of course linked. ‘Art is a commodity like any other,’ said Daniel Kahnweiler, Picasso’s dealer. Art is an aesthetic commodity. In order to be clear, the art market can be defined as an identifiable set of institutions and commercial organisations which collectively fund, promote and sell art. Art must be (and always has been) elitist and exclusive in order to maintain its financial value and prestige. Many modern artists use aesthetic elitism to guarantee exclusivity which, in turn, ensures values are upheld. Hence, art functions to distinguish rich people from poorer people. Good art is aesthetically stimulating, bad art is aesthetically neutral. The criteria that determine whether something is aesthetically stimulating or aesthetically neutral are partly subject to social change. Good art always contains an element of disorder (discontinuity), bad art simply reinforces a pre-existing order.Good art promotes discontinuity, bad art enforces continuity. Discontinuity produces aesthetically stimulating experiences, continuity produces aesthetically neutral experiences.1 Discontinuity is the basis of all creation, but discontinuity is meaningless without continuity.1 Rich aesthetic experience is generated by the perception, simultaneously, of continuity and discontinuity in the same event.1 All stimulating design relies on balancing the relative quotients of order and disorder in the object. This also goes for the composition of music and literature. However, such judgements cannot be made in isolation from the fact that values of order and disorder are largely prescribed by social agreement.1 Posthuman art uses technology to promote discontinuity. Healthy societies tolerate the promotion of discontinuity since they understand that humans need exposure to it, in spite of themselves. Unhealthy societies discourage the promotion of discontinuity.1 Creativity does not consist in the production of anything that is completely new. Creativity consists in combining things that already exist, but which had previously been held as separate. Creativity and aesthetic appreciation are both functions of the human ability to modify the connections in their thought paths, or to have them modified.1 The process of aesthetic stimulation is heightened when concepts are forced together from relatively diverse locations in a discontinuous way. The amount of energy required to contemplate diverse concepts produces the physical rush of excitement familiar to those who appreciate art. VIII. Statements on synthetic beings We already have machines that can learn, but their abilities are currently limited by the fact that they are logical. Logic is an idealised, self-referential system developed by human imagination. Since there are few things less logical in behaviour than humans, any machine that is restricted to using logic as its base will never display human characteristics. Currently the output of computers is predictable. The posthuman era begins in full when the output of computers is unpredictable. Most artificial intelligence machines are hermetically sealed. They are limited by the complexity of the calculations our machines can perform. They are only sensitive to a finite number of stimuli, and the quotient of randomness intruding upon them is relatively small. Human thought is not a hermetic, linear system. Since we know that the mind, body and environment cannot be separated, we cannot rule out the impact of any environmental stimuli on the process of thought, no matter how minute it might seem. What is essential to the functioning of human consciousness is that the mind receives a continuous input of random stimuli from the environment. The human mind has evolved to absorb the unexpected — the discontinuous stimulus. The compulsion to assert order in the face of random stimuli contributes to our sense of being. Therefore, if we are to create any synthetic intelligence that has a sense of being like that we recognise in ourselves it must be sensitive to the same level of random interruption as humans. It must have a compulsion to re-assert meaning in the face of both stable and unstable input, whilst also being able to adapt to and take advantage of the creative possibilities offered by non-linear stimuli. If we wish to produce a synthetic intelligence that displays creativity then we need it to be able to establish connections between its thoughts in a discontinuous way. This will be achieved by making it perpetually sensitive to random stimuli. If we wish to produce a synthetic intelligence that displays aesthetic appreciation then it should be able to sense continuity and discontinuity simultaneously — without crashing. Whilst this would cause excitement in the machine it is yet to be determined to what extent it would be pleasurable. Humanists saw themselves as distinct beings in an antagonistic relationship with their surroundings. Posthumans, on the other hand, regard their own being as embodied in an extended technological world. Over the last decade the possibility of innovations in areas such as artificial intelligence or biotechnology contributing to the emergence of a posthuman life form has become a focal point of public debate and mainstream artistic concern. This multi-disciplinary discourse is premised on developments in the so-called NBIC technologies – Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, Information Technology and Cognitive Science. The transhumanist claim that human nature should be improved technologically is likewise predicated on the NBIC suite affording the necessary means for enhancement. In philosophy, discussion of the posthuman has been dominated by concerns about the ethics of enhancement or by metaphysical issues of embodiment and mind. Transhumanists draw on Enlightenment conceptions of human nature as an improvable work in progress in arguing for the moral benefits of enhancement and its political legitimacy. Likewise, bioconservative critics of transhumanism employ traditional frameworks such as Christian theology and Aristotelianism to argue that such developments may violate the biological integrity of species or undermine constitutive conditions for the good furnished by an unbiddable nature. Speculative Posthumanism does not deny the importance of these debates but claims that they are too regional in scope to address the potential for ontological novelty implied by NBIC technologies. If it is possible for our technical activity to ultimately engender radically non-human forms of life we must confront the possibility that our wide technological descendants will be so alien as to fall outside the public ethical frameworks employed by the majority of transhumanists and bioconservatives. Among the intellectuals to have appreciated the ontological stakes are those poststructuralists and critical posthumanists who claim that the trajectory of current technoscientific change deconstructs the philosophical centrality of the human subject in epistemology and politics – by, for example, levelling differences between human subjects, non-human animals, or cybernetic systems. However, while critical posthumanism has yielded important insights it is hamstrung by a default anti-realism inherited from the dominant traditions in post-Kantian continental philosophy. The deconstruction of subjectivity is an ambivalent philosophical achievement at best; one that cedes ground to potent forms of humanism while failing to address the cosmic likelihood of a posthuman dispensation. Speculative Posthumanism accordingly rejects the post-Kantian epistemology that deploys the posthuman as a fashionable trope to mark intrinsic limits on thought. Its project is speculative insofar as it explores ways of conceiving the posthuman independently of its relationship to human cognitive forms or phenomenology. It argues, instead, that the posthuman should be understood as a real, though not-yet actual, condition resulting from the technological modification of humans or their wide technological descendants. Speculative Posthumanism claims that an augmentation history of this kind is metaphysically and technically possible. It does not imply that the posthuman would improve upon the human state or that there would exist a scale of values by which human and posthuman lives could be compared. If radically posthuman lives were very non-human indeed, we should not assume them to be prospectively evaluable using the ethical frameworks available to us. This does not indicate that the posthuman is impossible or, like the God of negative theology, transcends our epistemic capacities. Rather this proposition indicates a problem that is still ours insofar as the posthuman could result from an iteration of our current technical praxis.`
